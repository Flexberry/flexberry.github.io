## Description 

This step describes the settings Ember app for local application. These settings must be applied, because the developed web apps in Ember is not intended for local work. 

## Basic settings 

For local Ember app in Apache Cordova, you must do the following: 

{% include note.html content="All subsequent actions should be executed in the directory Ember app" %} 

1.In the file `environment.js` located in the folder `config` you must change the following: 

* Parameter `baseURL` model on `rootURL`. 
* PstrflocationType` parameter to replace the value `auto` on `none`.

2.In the file `index.html` located in the folder `app` all tags `script` referencing third party sources (e.g. `src="//cdn.polyfill.io/v1/polyfill.js?features=es6"`), we need to add the Protocol `https` or `http`.

## configure drop folder output filoi 

To configure the drop folder output filoi ember apps in a folder `www` when you build a mobile app, you must add the parameter `"output-path": "../www"` in the configuration file `.ember-cli`, which is located in the root directory `Ember приложения`, this file can be opened in any code editor.

{% include note.html content="Unless this option is set, then you will need to manually transfer the output files ember app from the dist folder into the www directory mobile app" %} 

## setting otobrazheniya icons 

For correct display of icons in the Ember application, you need to remove `/assets/` from the path to the icons in the file `font-icon.css` located in the folder `vendor` Ember application.
