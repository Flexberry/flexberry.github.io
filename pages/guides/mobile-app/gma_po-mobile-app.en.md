## Description 

In this step, you will be presented with a list of required software obespecheniya for mobile app development on the platform of Apache Cordova. 

Basic software: 
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version: 5.11 to 6.11 
- [Bower](https://bower.io/#install-bower) 
- [Ember-CLI](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.14.0/getting-started/#toc_installation) version 2.4.3 
- [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/index.html#installing-the-cordova-cli) 

## Android 

For developing mobile applications for the Android platform requires the following software: 
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) 
- [Android Studio and the Platform SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html) 

After the software installation is necessary to make [the setting up of variables sredy](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/7.x/guide/platforms/android/index.html#setting-environment-variables). 

Develop mobile applications for Android can be running any operating system. 

## iOS 

Developing mobile apps for iOS runs only in OS X operating system on Intel-based computers XcodeÂ® 7.0 (minimum required version) runs only on OS X version 10.10.4 (Yosemite) or higher, and includes the iOS 9 SDK (Software Development Kit). 

Required software: 
- [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12). After installing Xcode to run Cordova, you need to enable a few command line tools. At the command prompt, run the command: `xcode-select --install`. 
- Tool [ios-deploy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ios-deploy) allows you to run iOS app on device from the command line. 

The result of this step was made to install and configure the necessary software to create a mobile app using the Apache Cordova platform. Next will be described the process of creating a Cordova app.
