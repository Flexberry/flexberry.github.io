## Description 

This guide shows you how to create a mobile app for Android and iOS platform `Flexberry`. 

Developing client web applications using platform `Flexberry` based on the use of JavaScript framework `Ember.js`. There are two scenarios of mobile application development:

2. Developing custom web application using Ember-addon [ember-flexberry](https://flexberry.github.io/ru/ef3_landing_page.html). 

After creating the client web application, you can move on to creating a mobile app.
