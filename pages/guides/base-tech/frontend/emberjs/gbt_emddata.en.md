## Brief description 

The contents of this page: 

* models, standard attribute types, the standard types of relationships. 
* store, work with it, the basic methods and features. 
* transformation, and the ability to implement their attribute types with them 
* adapters (types, features, key responsibilities and the methods available) features to access them (when I have the adapter for specific model application refer to him as such â€“ no, refer to the adapter application) 
* serializer (their types, features, key responsibilities and available methods) features appeal to them
