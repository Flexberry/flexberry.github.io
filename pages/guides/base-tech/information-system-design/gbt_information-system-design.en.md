## Brief description 

In this section collected papers on the following technologies: 

* [**Object-oriented programming (OOP)**](gbt_ood.html) is a programming methodology based on the representation of programs as a set of objects, each of which is an instance of a particular class, and classes form an inheritance hierarchy. 
* [**The UML (eng. Unified Modeling Language — unified modeling language)**](gbt_uml.html) is a language of graphic description for object modeling in the field of software development, modeling business processes, system design and mapping organizational structures. 
* [**A design pattern or pattern (eng. design pattern)**](gbt_design-patterns.html) in software development — repeatable architectural design representing a solution to the problem of design in the context of a frequently occurring context.
