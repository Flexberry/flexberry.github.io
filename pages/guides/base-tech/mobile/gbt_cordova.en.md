## Brief description 

**Apache Cordova** (old name PhoneGap) mobile application development environment, originally developed by Nitobi. Adobe Systems acquired Nitobi in 2011 and rebranded PhoneGap released version of the open source software called Apache Cordova. 

Apache Cordova allows you to create applications for mobile devices using CSS3, HTML5 and JavaScript, instead use platform-specific API, such as Android, IOS or Windows Phone. This is due to the conversion of CSS, HTML and JavaScript code that any platform is perceived as an element of the web. It extends the capabilities of HTML and JavaScript to work with different devices. 

The resulting application is hybrid, which means that they are neither truly mobile application (because all layout generation are using the web view instead of the main structure of the user interface platform) or the web because they are not only web application, but packaged as apps for distribution and have access to the API the basic functions of the device, such as a file system, camera, etc.). 

The software was previously called just «PhoneGap», and «then Apache Cordova». As open-source Apache Cordova is used in other programs such as Appery.io or Intel XDK.
