summary: the Variant end-to-end specifications for the design and development using the framework Flexberry Ember 
--- 

## Job 

In the framework of the practical part of the course you will have developed end-to-end example: application «weather Forecast» (IP to conduct forecast the weather for different areas). 

The first part of the practical exercises will be devoted to the development of basic technologies, such as C#, databases, client technology, etc., the second part will include a study of the possibilities of the platform Flexberry to efficiently create applications. 

## General description of the subject area 

Every 2 hours specialist meteorological service runs the algorithm for calculating the forecast for the given territory. The algorithm can give extreme values, which are adjusted in manual mode (for example, -150 ° C in June). Users of weather forecasts are accessed via the Internet and can choose the area for which the forecast is based. Available forecast for the month ahead from current date. The user can subscribe to a notification E-Mail about an upcoming natural disaster, specifying the time interval prior to and territories. 

Specifications: 

* The application is realized as [SPA -] (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Одностраничное_приложение) bakenda on the C# and EmberJS on the frontend. 
* Data is stored in the database Postgres. 

## Practical task no 1 - server development (C#, .NET ASP.NET) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

You want to implement an algorithm simulating the operation of the system of weather forecast. The input will need to submit a site id, the output should be a list of forecast parameters for each day for 30 days relative to the current date. The weather forecast settings: 
* Date 
* Air temperature in degrees Celsius 
* Cloud 
* Weather phenomena 
* Pressure in mm Hg 
* Wind direction 
* Wind speed 
* The wind speed in the gusts 

The forecast should be uniform, i.e. weather changes in various parameters should be relatively smooth, without abrupt jumps in different directions. The parameters must be consistent with each other, i.e., 28 degrees and snow do not occur. Add 5% deviation algorithm, which will give a sharply arbitrary, but consistent evidence of individual settings that you will need to adjust forecasters in manual mode. 
The implementation should be done .net-libraries and to prepare unit tests (xUnit), to demonstrate the percentage of code coverage from unit tests (the more the better). 

### Providing performance verification 

The implemented solution (Visual Studio Solution) to put it all in a repository on GitHub (the solution must compile and run). A link to the repository to provide the teachers of the course. 

## Practical exercise No. 2 - Client-side development (HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Code editor for client development: Visual Studio Code 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

With use of opportunities HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery mark up a form where the user can easily see the forecast for several possible intervals: 7 days, 14 days, 30 days. The intervals need to switch tabs. 7 days are issued in the form of a single line. 14 days - two rows for 7 days in a row, 30 days - 3 lines, 10 days. Each cell containing a date must include all the information about the weather in a short form. By clicking on a cell should open a popup form with detailed information of each parameter when the weather is signed. 

### to deliver results 

Implemented project to place in a repository on GitHub in the form of resident pages GitHub Pages that allows you to view the finished result. A link to the published repository and thus the project to provide teachers of the course. 

## Practical exercise No. 3 - Client-side development using a SPA-framework (EmberJS) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Code editor for client development: Visual Studio Code 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

You want to implement EmberJS application, which will be implemented form where the user can easily see the forecast for several possible intervals: 7 days, 14 days, 30 days. The intervals need to switch tabs. 7 days are issued in the form of a single line. 14 days - two rows for 7 days in a row, 30 days - 3 lines, 10 days. Each cell containing a date must include all the information about the weather in a short form. By clicking on a cell should open a popup form with detailed information of each parameter when the weather is signed. To provide for the editing mode that is available to the user of the meteorological service. In edit mode you can change the values of the weather parameters. 

In EmberJS-utilities need to implement an algorithm simulating the operation of the system of the weather (see # 1). 

The display of weather is required to: implement a component that receives EmberJS model. EmberJS-model, should be available from EmberJS-utility model hook in the routes of the form on which the component is added.

### to deliver results 

Implemented project to place in a repository on GitHub in the form of EmberJS project and published the app to GitHub Pages, which allow you to view the finished result. A link to the published repository and thus the project to provide teachers of the course. 

## Practical assignment No. 4 Database 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Postgres 
* pgAdmin 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

For the specified subject area to implement the database, fill the database with scripts (at least 5 records per table). Implement scripts to create constraints, indexes. 

Prepare SQL scripts to obtain the following information: 

1. Display the top 5 territories where the least rainy days 
2. Display information about the average temperature on that date for all territories 
3. Display information about the user who adjusts more often than other data 
4. Display information about the temperature records for the specified site during the observation 
5. List the areas where there was no rain for 30 days in a row and Vice versa, precipitation does not stop for 30 days in a row 

### to deliver results
