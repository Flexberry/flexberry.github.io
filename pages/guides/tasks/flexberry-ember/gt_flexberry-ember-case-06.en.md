summary: the Variant end-to-end specifications for the design and development using the framework Flexberry Ember 
--- 

## Job 

In the framework of the practical part of the course you will have developed end-to-end example: application «permit system in the office» (is to automate the account of movement of employees). 

The first part of the practical exercises will be devoted to the development of basic technologies, such as C#, databases, client technology, etc., the second part will include a study of the possibilities of the platform Flexberry to efficiently create applications. 

## General description of the subject area 

In the office of the company X introduced a permit system based on personal bandwidth maps. Using the card, the employee can go to any floor in the office, in public places (kitchen, peregovori, etc.) and only in his office. Required to develop an information system, which will include information on issued personal bandwidth maps, and information about staff movements. All doors of rooms in which working staff can be in 2 States: `замок открыт` and `замок закрыт`. During the working day, if the office employees are usually the door is in a state `замок открыт`. Thus, when moving between offices of the office staff do not always use the card. At the entrance and exit of the building office all staff members are required to use the card individually, it allows you to record the time of arrival of the employee in office and his care. 

Specifications: 

* The application is realized as [SPA -] (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Одностраничное_приложение) bakenda on the C# and EmberJS on the frontend. 
* Data is stored in the database Postgres. 

## Practical task no 1 - server development (C#, .NET ASP.NET) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

You want to implement an algorithm for computing the friendly relations of employees on the basis of information about a shared meal or arrival and departure from the office. If several employees throughout the week I left for lunch with a difference of no more than 5 minutes and was coming back from lunch with the same small difference is not less than 3 times, they are considered friends. If employees come into the office in the morning and leave in the evening at the same time with a difference not more than 5 minutes no less than 3 times, it is also considered to be friends.
The input to the algorithm is an array of structures that contain: 

* Name of employee and id 
* Array of tuples: date-time of arrival at the office, and date-time of departure from office 

The output should be an array of tuples, each of which contains information about the friendly relations between your employees. 
The implementation should be done .net-libraries and to prepare unit tests (xUnit), to demonstrate the percentage of code coverage from unit tests (the more the better). 

### Providing performance verification 

The implemented solution (Visual Studio Solution) to put it all in a repository on GitHub (the solution must compile and run). A link to the repository to provide the teachers of the course. 

## Practical exercise No. 2 - Client-side development (HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Code editor for client development: Visual Studio Code 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

With use of opportunities HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery mark up a form where the user can specify the name of the employee, year, month, and receive information about his office visits with the granularity of each day. The shape should resemble a monthly calendar, i.e., the table must have 7 columns (mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, sat, sun) and week in the rows. In each cell of the table must show the number and time of arrival-departure at the office (employee may visit the office). 

### to deliver results 

Implemented project to place in a repository on GitHub in the form of resident pages GitHub Pages that allows you to view the finished result. A link to the published repository and thus the project to provide teachers of the course. 

## Practical exercise No. 3 - Client-side development using a SPA-framework (EmberJS) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Code editor for client development: Visual Studio Code 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

You want to implement EmberJS application, which will be implemented form where the user can specify the name of the employee, year, month, and receive information about his office visits with the granularity of each day. The shape should resemble a monthly calendar, i.e., the table must have 7 columns (mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, sat, sun) and week in the rows. In each cell of the table must show the number and time of arrival-departure at the office (employee may visit the office). Under the calendar should display a list of likely friends of the employee (EmberJS-component). 

In EmberJS-utilities need to implement an algorithm for computing the friendly relations of employees on the basis of information about a shared meal or arrival and departure from the office (see # 1). 

You want to implement the component, passing it the employee id, year and month, and it displays a list of employees who may be friends of the staff member. To use EmberJS component-a utility calculation algorithm of friendly relations.

### to deliver results 

Implemented project to place in a repository on GitHub in the form of EmberJS project and published the app to GitHub Pages, which allow you to view the finished result. A link to the published repository and thus the project to provide teachers of the course. 

## Practical assignment No. 4 Database 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Postgres 
* pgAdmin
