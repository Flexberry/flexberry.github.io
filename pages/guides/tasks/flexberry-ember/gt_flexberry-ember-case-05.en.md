--- 

## Job 

In the framework of the practical part of the course you will have developed end-to-end example: application «Paid Parking» (IP for automation of accounting of parked cars). 

The first part of the practical exercises will be devoted to the development of basic technologies, such as C#, databases, client technology, etc., the second part will include a study of the possibilities of the platform Flexberry to efficiently create applications. 

## General description of the subject area 

On the territory of the city are paid Parking areas with a total capacity of 1000 seats. The drivers can use to pay for Parking through the website. Monitoring payment runs reconciliation rooms a parked car with the list of paid Parking lots. You want to develop an application which will take into account the payment of Parking or the fact of evacuation of the car (the driver who violated the Parking rules through this application will be able to learn about the fact of evacuation, and the cost of the fine and the point of evacuation). For drivers proposed payment rate tied to an hour of Parking. One hour - 10 rubles. Payment can be made in one hour, per working day (the rate is set to 8 hours) or calendar month (150 hours). The penalties for non-payment of Parking depend on the number of violations: first offense - 100 hours, the second 200 hours, and the third 300 hours and so on. Payment invoice will be issued for Parking since the discovery till the time of evacuation and a fine. 

Specifications: 

* The application is realized as [SPA -] (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Одностраничное_приложение) bakenda on the C# and EmberJS on the frontend. 
* Data is stored in the database Postgres.

Will be required for implementation: 

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

You want to implement the algorithm of calculation of fees paid Parking during the month based on these parameters: 
* The cost of one hour Parking 
* Average monthly percentage of occupancy of Parking spaces 
* The number of violations (first, second, third time) 

The output should be represented by the sum of charges paid Parking. 
The implementation should be done .net-libraries and to prepare unit tests (xUnit), to demonstrate the percentage of code coverage from unit tests (the more the better).

### Providing performance verification 

The implemented solution (Visual Studio Solution) to put it all in a repository on GitHub (the solution must compile and run). A link to the repository to provide the teachers of the course. 

## Practical exercise No. 2 - Client-side development (HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Code editor for client development: Visual Studio Code 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

With use of opportunities HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery mark up a form where the user can enter data about your car (license plate) and go to the form of Parking fees or the form of search results of car among the evacuees. Form of payment of Parking should provide an interface for specifying payment period (how many hours, days, months) and to provide information about the cost in accordance with the selected number. The form of search results of car among the evacuees must first 5 seconds show the element mapping of the data then, depending on probability of 0.3 show a message with the information on the evacuated car or with information that the "car not found, please contact 112 about the theft". 

### to deliver results 

Implemented project to place in a repository on GitHub in the form of resident pages GitHub Pages that allows you to view the finished result. A link to the published repository and thus the project to provide teachers of the course.

* Git for Windows 

### Job 

You want to implement EmberJS application, which will be implemented form where the user can enter data about your car (license plate) and go to the form of Parking fees or the form of search results of car among the evacuees. Form of payment of Parking should provide an interface for specifying payment period (how many hours, days, months) and to provide information about the cost in accordance with the selected number. The form of search results of car among the evacuees must first 5 seconds show the element mapping of the data then, depending on probability of 0.3 show a message with the information on the evacuated car or with information that the "car not found, please contact 112 about the theft" (to bind to bakedu in this task is not necessary). 

In EmberJS-utilities are required to implement the algorithm for calculating the cost of Parking based on the input data: 
* The number of 
* Unit 

The output should be represented by the cost of Parking. 

To use this component in EmberJS-utility when you change any parameter to recalculate and display the Parking cost to the user.

### to deliver results 

Implemented project to place in a repository on GitHub in the form of EmberJS project and published the app to GitHub Pages, which allow you to view the finished result. A link to the published repository and thus the project to provide teachers of the course. 

## Practical assignment No. 4 Database 

Will be required for implementation:

### Job 

For the specified subject area to implement the database, fill the database with scripts (at least 5 records per table). Implement scripts to create constraints, indexes. 

Prepare SQL scripts to obtain the following information: 

1. What evacuation zone have the highest fines on the amounts? 
2. Display the top 5 cars that spend most of their time on paid Parking 
3. Display top-5 car owners who have more cars 
4. List the parked cars on the specified date and time 
5. List of cars that have been evacuated twice in the same day 

### to deliver results
