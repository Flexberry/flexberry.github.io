--- 

## Job 

In the framework of the practical part of the course you will have developed end-to-end example: application «table tennis» (IP for automation of the account of results of games of table tennis). 

The first part of the practical exercises will be devoted to the development of basic technologies, such as C#, databases, client technology, etc., the second part will include a study of the possibilities of the platform Flexberry to efficiently create applications. 


## General description of the subject area 

There is a list of players who play table tennis. Every game involved two players. Each match consists of one or more parties. Each party is played to 11 or to 21 points one of the players, or when playing in more or less, to 12 or 22 points, respectively. In one match, all parties must play the same number of points. Each match is played in a certain date/time. Matches between players can be planned in advance. 

Each player has a rating. When you add to the system the player is assigned a rating of 1400. After the match between the two players, the rating of each of the participants must change in accordance with the calculation formula [Elo](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Рейтинг_Эло). The change needs to happen at each party, but only in the context of the match. Players can play unranked matches, the results of which should not be considered in the rating. 

Among a certain group of players can be arranged with the tournament. The tournament is held in a given period of time. Rules of the tournament secured many victories in the parties must continue the match between the players of the tournament, short or long should be of the party. All parties in the framework of the tournaments are rated. The result of the tournament is the final table with the distribution of seats in the tournament. 

Specifications: 

* The application is realized as [SPA -] (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Одностраничное_приложение) bakenda on the C# and EmberJS on the frontend. 
* Data is stored in the database Postgres. 

## Practical task no 1 - server development (C#, .NET ASP.NET) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

You want to implement the algorithm recalculate Elo for the match result between the two players with given rank values. The input of the algorithm ratings of both the participants and the match result is 1, 0, -1. The algorithm must return a new value of the rating of both players. Should be a flexible adjustment of the rating algorithm calculation to change the K-factor, as well as the feasibility of the algorithm with different K value for different values of the ratings of the players (similar to a chess rating in the article on Wikipedia). 

The implementation should be done .net-libraries and to prepare unit tests (xUnit), to demonstrate the percentage of code coverage from unit tests (the more the better). 

### Providing performance verification 

The implemented solution (Visual Studio Solution) to put it all in a repository on GitHub (the solution must compile and run). A link to the repository to provide the teachers of the course. 

## Practical exercise No. 2 - Client-side development (HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Code editor for client development: Visual Studio Code 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

With use of opportunities HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery mark up a form where you can enter the match results. It should be possible to enter score and score in every game. The form should also be a unit for input of players, date of match, length of party and number of victories by the parties, which played the match. Must be controlled by business rules relating to the possible account of the party. Billing parties should be given the opportunity to choose the number of points in the beautiful a pop-up list. 

### to deliver results 

Implemented project to place in a repository on GitHub in the form of resident pages GitHub Pages that allows you to view the finished result. A link to the published repository and thus the project to provide teachers of the course. 

## Practical exercise No. 3 - Client-side development using a SPA-framework (EmberJS) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Code editor for client development: Visual Studio Code 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

You want to implement EmberJS app, which will add the form to enter match results. The form must be implemented using capabilities EmberJS. It should be possible to enter score and score in every game. The form should also be a unit for input of players, date of match, length of party and number of victories by the parties, which played the match. Must be controlled by business rules relating to the possible account of the party. 
In EmberJS-utilities are required to implement the algorithm recalculate Elo for the match result between the two players with the given values of the ratings (similar to the algorithm implemented on the server side). The input of the algorithm ratings of both the participants and the match result is 1, 0, -1. The algorithm must return a new value of the rating of both players. Should be a flexible adjustment of the rating algorithm calculation to change the K-factor, as well as the feasibility of the algorithm with different K value for different values of the ratings of the players (similar to a chess rating in the article on Wikipedia). 
To develop in the form of an Ember component, the controls that implement the logic input ratings of the two participants, and the conversion factor of rating and calculation of new ratings (fields to enter values button, the unit displays the result), to recalculate designed to connect EmberJS-utility. 

### to deliver results 

Implemented project to place in a repository on GitHub in the form of EmberJS project and published the app to GitHub Pages, which allow you to view the finished result. A link to the published repository and thus the project to provide teachers of the course. 

## Practical assignment No. 4 Database 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Postgres 
* pgAdmin 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

For the specified subject area to implement the database, fill the database with scripts (at least 5 records per table). Implement scripts to create constraints, indexes. 

Prepare SQL scripts to obtain the following information: 

1. The current rating of the players in descending order 
2. The last N changes in the ranking of the player 
3. The last N matches of the player 
4. Latest N personal meetings between the two players 
5. The final table of the tournament 
6. All tournament matches in chronological order 

### to deliver results
