summary: the Variant end-to-end specifications for the design and development using the framework Flexberry Ember 
--- 

## Job 

In the framework of the practical part of the course you will have developed end-to-end example: application «Network educational program». 
The first part of the practical exercises will be devoted to the development of basic technologies, such as C#, databases, client technology, etc., the second part will include a study of the possibilities of the platform Flexberry to efficiently create applications. 

## General description of the subject area 

You want to develop an application to control the network educational programs. The student goes to basic school, but in the course of learning may take individual modules (similar to semesters) to other organizations (for example, at another University, or industrial company) with which the base organization has agreements. 
We assume that the master's program is considered, i.e. 4 modules. To pass the module in another organization, the student indicates their preference: first, second and third priority. 
Specifications: 

* The application is realized as [SPA -] (https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Одностраничное_приложение) bakenda on the C# and EmberJS on the frontend. 
* Data is stored in the database Postgres. 

## Practical task no 1 - server development (C#, .NET ASP.NET) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

You want to implement an algorithm for checking the correctness of the entered number agreement. The number format of the contract must be independently invented, e.g., `00ААА0000А0`. 
The implementation should be done .net-libraries and to prepare unit tests for it, to show the percentage of code coverage from unit tests (the more the better). 

### Providing performance verification 

The implemented solution (Visual Studio Solution) to put it all in a repository on GitHub (the solution must compile and run). A link to the repository to provide the teachers of the course. 

## Practical exercise No. 2 - Client-side development (HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Code editor for client development: Visual Studio Code 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

With use of opportunities HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery mark up a form that will display the list of choices available in educational programs for the entire period of study. Each semester must be a separate unit indicating the number of semesters and date interval (blocks semesters go from top to bottom). Within each block of the semester are available for student blocks educational programs with a brief description (placed horizontally at the same level). From semester to semester, the number can change. The student should develop these programs in accordance with their preferences (by clicking and dragging the blocks with a brief description of the educational program with the mouse or by using the buttons on the interface) - unit educational program located on the left has the highest priority, the block on the far right is the smallest. 

### to deliver results 

Implemented project to place in a repository on GitHub in the form of embedded pages [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) that allows you to view the finished result. A link to the published repository and thus the project to provide teachers of the course. 

## Practical exercise No. 3 - Client-side development using a SPA-framework (EmberJS) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Code editor for client development: Visual Studio Code 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

You want to implement EmberJS application, which will be implemented form, which will display a list of choices available in educational programs for the entire period of study. Each semester must be a separate unit indicating the number of semesters and date interval (blocks semesters go from top to bottom). Within each block of the semester are available for student blocks educational programs with a brief description (placed horizontally at the same level). From semester to semester, the number can change. The student should develop these programs in accordance with their preferences (by clicking and dragging the blocks with a brief description of the educational program with the mouse or by using the buttons on the interface) - unit educational program located on the left has the highest priority, the block on the far right is the smallest. 

In EmberJS-utilities need to implement an algorithm for checking the correctness of the entered number agreement (similar to the algorithm from task 1). 
To develop in the form of an Ember component, the controls that implement: 
1. The logic of check of a correctness of entering of the contract using the library of tasks above (field values button, the unit displays the check result) 
2. Display brief information on the contract for the listed number (field values button, the unit displays the result). In this task summary information on contracts is enough to have a code, not to take from the database. 

### to deliver results 

Implemented project to place in a repository on GitHub in the form of EmberJS project and published the app to GitHub Pages, which allow you to view the finished result. A link to the published repository and thus the project to provide teachers of the course. 

## Practical assignment No. 4 Database 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Postgres 
* pgAdmin 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

For the specified subject area to implement the database, fill the database with scripts (at least 5 records per table). Implement scripts to create constraints, indexes. To attach the scripts to create the database and populate, Bacup database. 

Prepare SQL scripts to obtain the following information: 

1. List of students who chose the first priority for the specified organization. 
2. Withdraw the rating of associations is built on the principle: for each student 1-th priority is given 3 points, 2nd priority - 2 points, 3rd priority - 1 point. 
3. For each student, output the sign of the zodiac 
4. On a specified date to bring the list of educational organizations which have a valid contract. 
5. For the student to bring all his preferences for all modules. 


### to deliver results 

Implemented scripts commit in the GitHub repository. A link to the repository to provide the teachers of the course. 

## the Practical task №5 - IC Design
