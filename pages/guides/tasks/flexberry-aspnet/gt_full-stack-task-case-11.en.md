### Job. Part 1. 

You want to implement the algorithm for computing the value of the annual visits for the specified student. Each group has an integer property «annual visit to», which is used to calculate the value. The cost depends on the use of the hostel (the fixed cost of the hostel per month). Students with a preferential category have a 50% discount. 

The implementation should be done .net-libraries and to prepare unit tests for it, to show the percentage of code coverage from unit tests (the more the better). 

### Job. Part 2. 

Implement a simple ASP.NET WebForms-application (at this stage, no database), which contains the components (. ascx controls), realizowa: 

1. Logic to input parameters required to calculate the cost of annual visits, actually using a library to calculate and print the result. 
2. The logic to display the total cost of training of students of the group. Report the number of students, the cost of education in this group, then put information on each of them, and the button displays the total cost for the group.

Prepare SQL scripts to obtain the following information: 

1. List of students, payment of the institution which was the maximum for the entire period of their training. 
2. Display top N students with the highest number of crossings at grade over the entire period. 
3. To bring the educational institution in which studied less students in the past from the current year. 
4. To rank educational institutions by average tuition fees for the current year. 
5. Withdraw the amount of the fee for each student over the years, indicating the educational institution and class. 
6. To bring the educational institution in which there were precedents with the processing of the application longer than N days.
