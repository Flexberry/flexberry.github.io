## Job 

In the framework of the practical part of the course you will have developed end-to-end example: application «pre-trial appeal to the Executive authorities» (module IC for state agencies). 

The first part of the practical exercises will be devoted to the development of basic technologies, such as C#, databases, client technology, etc., the second part will include a study of the possibilities of the platform Flexberry to efficiently create applications. 

## General description of the subject area 

The applicant has the right to file a complaint against the actions or inaction of the authorities providing public services. For example, the place of provision of services refused to accept the documents or to provide the service, violated the terms of service or require additional documents or payment. 

A citizen makes a complaint to public authority (office). The complaint is made in the same office which rendered the state service. Decorated the complaint sent to the Federal state information system of state appeals (hereinafter FGIS). FGIS provides TO the process of pre-trial (extrajudicial) appeal of decisions and actions (inaction) committed in the provision of public and municipal services. 

You want to create a separate module of the application to a public authority (agencies). This module should cover the need of fixation of information about complaints of citizens to public services. It is known that:

* compiled for a specific public service and the office of her оказывающее; 
* each Department has its own set of rendering state услуг; 
* the complaint can be attached документы; 
* the complaint should be handled by a specialist. Specialist records the date and complaint number, and monitors the processing status of the complaint.

* Date of receiving the complaint. 
* The number of complaints. The sequence number of the complaints in the application. Every year, the counter is reset to zero. 

The algorithm of formation of this unique code you need to invent your own. Code should be built in such a way that it should be implemented the potential to calculate the complaint in the application (from a known list), without storing the correspondence between the complaint and the code TO FGIS. The algorithm follows in the comments to make a description of the selected variant of the algorithm, because valid different ways to generate the code. 

The implementation should be done .net-libraries and to prepare unit tests for it, to show the percentage of code coverage from unit tests (the more the better). 

### Job. Part 2. 

Implement a simple ASP.NET WebForms-application (at this stage, no database), which contains the components (. ascx controls), realizowa: 

1. Logic input search query unique code and use the library from the previous paragraph for the release of information about the complaint (field values button, the unit displays the result). In this case, instead of the ID office should display its name. 
2. The logic to obtain the unique code on the complaint number, the date of receipt of the complaint, the Department ID field (input, button, block, displaying results).

* If there is at least one complaint «and» has Received no complaints with a status of» «Redirected, then display comprehensive status = New» qmo. 
* When transferring a complaint to another Agency to change its status to Redirected» «complex the Agency status should change to Urgent» qmo. 

7. Complaints with statuses «Processed»,» «is Closed you cannot move.
