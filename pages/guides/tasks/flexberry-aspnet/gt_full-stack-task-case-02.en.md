## Job 

In the framework of the practical part of the course you will have developed end-to-end example: application «Statements of applicants» (module on IP for universities). 

The first part of the practical exercises will be devoted to the development of basic technologies, such as C#, databases, client technology, etc., the second part will include a study of the possibilities of the platform Flexberry to efficiently create applications. 

## General description of the subject area 

You want to create a module of accounting statements of applicants for admission to the University. Each person in one year may submit one application to one institution, which may indicate multiple occupations, which wants to do. These majors prioritizers (some want more, some less).

Perm, St. Красная`, `ул. Blue, d. 45, kV. 111, mountains. Пермь`. If the address cannot be mapped, output the error message. 

The implementation should be done .net-libraries and to prepare unit tests for it, to show the percentage of code coverage from unit tests (the more the better). 

### Job. Part 2. 

Implement a simple ASP.NET WebForms-application (at this stage, no database), which contains the components (. ascx controls), realizowa: 

1. Logic input addresses, where each address element is entered in its own field and using the library from the preceding paragraph for the issuance of information in a uniform format (field values button, the unit displays the result). 
2. The logic of getting the full address on one input string and using the library from the preceding paragraph for the issuance of information in a uniform format (field values button, the unit displays the result).

### Job 

You have to develop a web interface for entering data about the applicant's application. To do this: 

* A hat to put the necessary private fields of application. 
* His masters and detaily (person / area) to place below the tabs. 
* Tab with career choices should allow you to drag and drop (Drag'n'drop) the appropriate specialty from the list in the list of the specific student. In this case from the General list to remove them, so you can't choose twice. 
* List of selected specialties to display in the header, separated by commas. 

### to deliver results 

Implemented project to place in a repository on GitHub in the form of embedded pages [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) that allows you to view the finished result. A link to the published repository and thus the project to provide teachers of the course. 

## Practical exercise No. 3 - the Database 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Microsoft SQL Server 
* Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

For the specified subject area to implement the database, fill the database with scripts (at least 5 records per table). Implement scripts to create constraints, indexes. To attach the scripts to create the database and populate, Bacup database. 
Prepare SQL scripts to obtain the following information: 

1. Display the TOP 10 areas by number of applicants 
2. Bring specialty, which filed the largest number of applications 
3. List the areas and the average number of applications over the years 
4. List of specialties and their» «rating (based on priority) 
5. Bring the average age of University entrants on specialities 

### to deliver results 

Implemented scripts commit in the GitHub repository. A link to the repository to provide the teachers of the course.

## Practical assignment # 4 - Designing the IP 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Flexberry Designer 

### Job 

Draw a UML diagram for the designated subject area. The composition of the diagrams is determined by the trainees, but should provide a full description of the subject area. 

### to deliver results 

The result is uploaded in the format of a CRP stage of Flexberry Designer. Stage (a file with the extension *.CRP) should commit to the repository on GitHub, the link to provide the teachers of the course. 

## the Practical task №5 - Object design and generation applications 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Flexberry Designer 
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 
* Microsoft SQL Server

### Job 

Execute object design and generation of ASP.NET applications for the described subject area. As a basis to use the previously implemented the UML model. Generation of the application and the database must be executed by means Flexberry Designer, the application must meet the requirements and be fully functional. Submission must be high quality customized signatures to classes and attributes on the forms should be adequate. The list of forms and attribute composition must correspond to the subject area and cover all of the required business function. 

### to deliver results 

The generated application and the scripts to create the database should be put in a repository on GitHub. To provide teachers with a reference to the repository.
