## Job 

In the framework of the practical part of the course you will have developed end-to-end example: application «lease of». 

The first part of the practical exercises will be devoted to the development of basic technologies, such as C#, databases, client technology, etc., the second part will include a study of the possibilities of the platform Flexberry to efficiently create applications. 

## General description of the subject area 

The city owns the land which is leased. Each plot has coordinates, can be form of a polygon (multiple points and the edges between them). The plot has a cost. Also the plot is assigned some coefficient, which may vary from year to year and these coefficients affect the value of a lease of the site. To lease land to a contract that has a date nacada action and expiration date. 

Specifications: 

* The application is implemented as a ASP.NET WebForms application. 
* Data is stored in the database MSSQL Server. 

## Practical task no 1 - server development (C#, .NET ASP.NET) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 
* Git for Windows 

### Job. Part 1. 

You want to implement the algorithm for calculating the area of the land plot to the coordinates. Coordinate can be any number. If you pass only 2 coordinates and less, the algorithm should generate an error. Coordinates should not be folded into overlapping itself a shape (e.g. a butterfly), if the passed the coordinates should give an error message. 

The implementation should be done .net-libraries and to prepare unit tests for it, to show the percentage of code coverage from unit tests (the more the better). 

### Job. Part 2. 

Implement a simple ASP.NET WebForms-application (at this stage, no database), which contains the components (. ascx controls), realizowa: 

1. The logic input of any number of coordinates and using the library from the previous paragraph for the release of information about the area of land (dynamically added fields for entering coordinate values, the button, the unit displays the result). 

### Providing performance verification 

The implemented solution (Visual Studio Solution) to put it all in a repository on GitHub (the solution must compile and run). A link to the repository to provide the teachers of the course. 

## Practical exercise No. 2 - Client-side development (HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Code editor for client development: Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, etc.
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

### to deliver results 

Implemented project to place in a repository on GitHub in the form of embedded pages [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) that allows you to view the finished result. A link to the published repository and thus the project to provide teachers of the course. 

## Practical exercise No. 3 - the Database 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Microsoft SQL Server 
* Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 


### to deliver results 

Implemented scripts commit in the GitHub repository. A link to the repository to provide the teachers of the course. 

## Practical assignment # 4 - Designing the IP 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Flexberry Designer 

### Job 

Draw a UML diagram for the designated subject area. The composition of the diagrams is determined by the trainees, but should provide a full description of the subject area. 

### to deliver results 

The result is uploaded in the format of a CRP stage of Flexberry Designer. Stage (a file with the extension *.CRP) should commit to the repository on GitHub, the link to provide the teachers of the course. 

## the Practical task №5 - Object design and generation applications 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Flexberry Designer 
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 
* Microsoft SQL Server 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

Execute object design and generation of ASP.NET applications for the described subject area. As a basis to use the previously implemented the UML model. Generation of the application and the database must be executed by means Flexberry Designer, the application must meet the requirements and be fully functional. Submission must be high quality customized signatures to classes and attributes on the forms should be adequate. The list of forms and attribute composition must correspond to the subject area and cover all of the required business function. 

### to deliver results 

The generated application and the scripts to create the database should be put in a repository on GitHub. To provide teachers with a reference to the repository. 

## Practical task №6 - Development of business logic applications 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Flexberry Designer 
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 
* Microsoft SQL Server 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

In generated using Flexberry Designer application is required to implement the following business logic. 

1. 
2. 

### to deliver results 

Modified business logic should be included in the development application and sakimichan in the appropriate repository. Link to the repository is available for inspection by the course instructors.

## Practical task №7 - Development of the UI application logic 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 
* Microsoft SQL Server 
* Code editor for client development: Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, etc. 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 


### to deliver results 

Modified UI logic should be included in the development application and sakimichan in the appropriate repository. Link to the repository is available for inspection by the course instructors. 

## Practical exercise No. 8 - the Functional subsystem Flexberry 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Flexberry Designer 
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 
* Microsoft SQL Server 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

The implemented application to configure the subsystem powers. Users must start the application administrator. Authorization form-based. To create a hierarchy of roles, add transactions to view the data and to grant rights only to specific users. To configure the roles and assign these roles to users. 

To configure the auditing subsystem. In the developed application, all changes to data objects must be recorded in the audit. In the navigation menu, you should add forms of audit that should only be shown to administrators. 

### to deliver results 

The revised application must be seamicro in the appropriate repository. Additionally, the repository must be added to the SQL scripts that need to perform to run an application with a subsystem of powers and audit. Link to the repository is available for inspection by the course instructors.
