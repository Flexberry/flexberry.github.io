## Job 

In the framework of the practical part of the course you will have developed end-to-end example: application» «sport school. 

The first part of the practical exercises will be devoted to the development of basic technologies, such as C#, databases, client technology, etc., the second part will include a study of the possibilities of the platform Flexberry to efficiently create applications. 

## General description of the subject area 

You want to create an app for sports schools. This application should cover the need of fixation of information about the athletes, their training and participation in competitions. 

It is known that athletes, within the section, organized into age groups. Each athlete must attend practices and games during the sports year. 

To provide in the application the ability to make a workout plan. Training consists of a set of exercises, each exercise is performed in a given pulse area, has its duration, number of repetitions and average heart rate. The results of the training and competition are recorded for each athlete separately. The pulse area is characterized by a minimum and maximum value, and score (an integer from 20 to 140). 

Information on these activities is recorded in the application. 

Specifications: 

* The application is implemented as a ASP.NET WebForms application. 
* Data is stored in the database MSSQL Server. 

## Practical task no 1 - server development (C#, .NET ASP.NET) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 
* Git for Windows 

### Job. Part 1. 

Required to implement the algorithm for calculating the load of the athlete during a training session, on the basis of time spent by the athlete in the pulse area. Each zone has its own score (units/hour): 1 – 20, 2 – 30, 3 – 40, 4-50, 5-60, 6-70, 7-80, 8-100, 9-120, 10-140. The algorithm of formation of the load following: the time spent in the area * the score of the corresponding zone. For example, during a training session the athlete was in the zone 1 12 minutes and 30 seconds in zone 2 and 30 minutes in zone 3, 5 minutes, 18 seconds. We define the received load as follows: (30/60 12)/60\*40 30/60\*60 (18/60 5)/60\*80 = 8,3 30 7=45,3 units/hour. 

The implementation should be done .net-libraries and to prepare unit tests for it, to show the percentage of code coverage from unit tests (the more the better). 


### Job. Part 2. 

Implement a simple ASP.NET WebForms-application (at this stage, no database), which contains the components (. ascx controls), realizowa: 

1. Search for athlete by name and code of the group. 
2. Enter data on time spent by the athlete in the pulse zones and the use of the library from the preceding paragraph for the issuance of information load (fields to enter values for each zone, button, block, displaying results). 

### Providing performance verification 

The implemented solution (Visual Studio Solution) to put it all in a repository on GitHub (the solution must compile and run). A link to the repository to provide the teachers of the course. 

## Practical exercise No. 2 - Client-side development (HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Code editor for client development: Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, etc. 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

With use of opportunities HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery impose a form of exercise. On the form you should see the following fields: 

* Name, age group and athlete. 
* Date of training scheduled and actual load 
* List of exercises: 

* Title 
* Run time in the format HH:MM:SS 
* Average heart rate 
* Load (calculated on the client, based on average heart rate, time and pulse points of the zone exercises) 

The number of entries in the list for exercise, equal to the number of repetitions of exercises. 

Should be able to add, delete, and move exercises together. 

The form also needs to be a block with summary information about the training: 

* Number of exercises 
* Duration 
* Average heart rate 
* Total load (actual). 

To realize the control input. 

To rely on the client the values of the unit with total info as well: 
* Age 
* Actual load 
* The load in exercise 

### to deliver results 

Implemented project to place in a repository on GitHub in the form of embedded pages [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) that allows you to view the finished result. A link to the published repository and thus the project to provide teachers of the course. 

## Practical exercise No. 3 - the Database 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Microsoft SQL Server 
* Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

For the specified subject area to implement the database, fill the database with scripts (at least 5 records per table). Implement scripts to create constraints, indexes. To attach the scripts to create the database and populate, Bacup database. 

Prepare SQL scripts to obtain the following information: 

1. Display a list of groups with number of athletes, as well as minimum and maximum age in the group. 
2. Output the number of visited and missed training athlete. 
3. Display summary information about training athletes over the past 3 weeks: date of exercise, amount of exercise, the training duration, actual load, average heart rate. 
4. Bring the top athletes load per workout. 
5. To obtain the average load for each athlete in the last 2 weeks, by days of the week. 

### to deliver results 

Implemented scripts commit in the GitHub repository. A link to the repository to provide the teachers of the course. 

## Practical assignment # 4 - Designing the IP 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Flexberry Designer 

### Job 

Draw a UML diagram for the designated subject area. The composition of the diagrams is determined by the trainees, but should provide a full description of the subject area. 

### to deliver results 

The result is uploaded in the format of a CRP stage of Flexberry Designer. Stage (a file with the extension *.CRP) should commit to the repository on GitHub, the link to provide the teachers of the course. 

## the Practical task №5 - Object design and generation applications 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Flexberry Designer 
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 
* Microsoft SQL Server
