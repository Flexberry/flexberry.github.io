### Job 

With use of opportunities HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery mark up a form that will display the child's daily routine in the kindergarten with regard to the temporal vector. Each stage should correspond to the graphical element, displaying its duration. Thus, the screen formed «line employment» child. The duration of some stages can be changed by changing the boundaries of an object, displaying a certain stage. The form also needs to be a block with information about the group number, the caregiver, number of children in the group, the number of missing due to illness. You must implement the facility enabling parents to make choices (for instance, when you click on the item «training» becomes available a list of possible topics or courses, when you click on the element» «lunch menu). 

### to deliver results 

Implemented project to place in a repository on GitHub in the form of embedded pages [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) that allows you to view the finished result. A link to the published repository and thus the project to provide teachers of the course.

* Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

For the specified subject area to implement the database, fill the database with scripts (at least 5 records per table). Implement scripts to create constraints, indexes. To attach the scripts to create the database and populate, Bacup database. 

Prepare SQL scripts to obtain the following information: 

1. List of children, payment of kindergarten which was the maximum for the entire period of their visit (regardless of kindergarten). 
2. Display top N children with the highest number of transitions for kindergartens for the entire period. 
3. Bring kindergartens, which were less children in the past from the current year. 
4. Grade the kindergartens at an average price of education for the current year. 
5. Withdraw the amount of the fee for each child over the years, indicating the kindergarten group. 
6. Display kindergartens in which there were precedents with the processing of the application longer than N days. 

### to deliver results
