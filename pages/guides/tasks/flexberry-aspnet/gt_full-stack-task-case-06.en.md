## Job 

In the framework of the practical part of the course you will have developed end-to-end example: application «Network educational program» (module on IP for universities). 
The first part of the practical exercises will be devoted to the development of basic technologies, such as C#, databases, client technology, etc., the second part will include a study of the possibilities of the platform Flexberry to efficiently create applications. 

## General description of the subject area 

You have to develop a module support in the management of network educational programs. The student goes to basic school, but in the course of learning may take individual modules (similar to semesters) to other organizations (for example, at another University, or industrial company) with which the base organization has agreements. 
We assume that the master's program is considered, i.e. 4 modules. To pass the module in another organization, the student indicates their preference: first, second and third priority. 
Specifications: 

* The application is implemented as a ASP.NET WebForms application. 
* Data is stored in the database MSSQL Server. 

## Practical task no 1 - server development (C#, .NET ASP.NET) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 
* Git for Windows 

### Job. Part 1. 

You want to implement an algorithm for checking the correctness of the entered number agreement. The number format of the contract must be independently invented, e.g., `00ААА0000А0`. 
The implementation should be done .net-libraries and to prepare unit tests for it, to show the percentage of code coverage from unit tests (the more the better). 

### Job. Part 2. 

Implement a simple ASP.NET WebForms-application (at this stage, no database), which contains the components (. ascx controls), realizowa: 

1. The logic of check of a correctness of entering of the contract using the library of tasks above (field values button, the unit displays the check result) 
2. Display brief information on the contract for the listed number (field values button, the unit displays the result). In this task summary information on contracts is enough to have a code, not to take from the database. 

### Providing performance verification 

The implemented solution (Visual Studio Solution) to put it all in a repository on GitHub (the solution must compile and run). A link to the repository to provide the teachers of the course.

## Practical exercise No. 2 - Client-side development (HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery) 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Code editor for client development: Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, etc. 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

With use of opportunities HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery mark up a form that will display the list of choices available in educational programs for the entire period of study. Each semester must be a separate unit indicating the number of semesters and date interval (blocks semesters go from top to bottom). Within each block of the semester are available for student blocks educational programs with a brief description (placed horizontally at the same level). From semester to semester, the number can change. The student should develop these programs in accordance with their preferences (by clicking and dragging the blocks with a brief description of the educational program with the mouse or by using the buttons on the interface) - unit educational program located on the left has the highest priority, the block on the far right is the smallest. 

### to deliver results 

Implemented project to place in a repository on GitHub in the form of embedded pages [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) that allows you to view the finished result. A link to the published repository and thus the project to provide teachers of the course. 

## Practical exercise No. 3 - the Database 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Microsoft SQL Server 
* Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

For the specified subject area to implement the database, fill the database with scripts (at least 5 records per table). Implement scripts to create constraints, indexes. To attach the scripts to create the database and populate, Bacup database. 

Prepare SQL scripts to obtain the following information: 

1. List of students who chose the first priority for the specified organization. 
2. Withdraw the rating of associations is built on the principle: for each student 1-th priority is given 3 points, 2nd priority - 2 points, 3rd priority - 1 point. 
3. For each student, output the sign of the zodiac 
4. On a specified date to bring the list of educational organizations which have a valid contract. 
5. For the student to bring all his preferences for all modules. 


### to deliver results 

Implemented scripts commit in the GitHub repository. A link to the repository to provide the teachers of the course. 

## Practical assignment # 4 - Designing the IP 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Flexberry Designer 

### Job 

Draw a UML diagram for the designated subject area. The composition of the diagrams is determined by the trainees, but should provide a full description of the subject area. 

### to deliver results 

The result is uploaded in the format of a CRP stage of Flexberry Designer. Stage (a file with the extension *.CRP) should commit to the repository on GitHub, the link to provide the teachers of the course. 

## the Practical task №5 - Object design and generation applications 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Flexberry Designer 
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 
* Microsoft SQL Server 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

Execute object design and generation of ASP.NET applications for the described subject area. As a basis to use the previously implemented the UML model. Generation of the application and the database must be executed by means Flexberry Designer, the application must meet the requirements and be fully functional. Submission must be high quality customized signatures to classes and attributes on the forms should be adequate. The list of forms and attribute composition must correspond to the subject area and cover all of the required business function. 

### to deliver results 

The generated application and the scripts to create the database should be put in a repository on GitHub. To provide teachers with a reference to the repository. 

## Practical task №6 - Development of business logic applications 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Flexberry Designer 
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 
* Microsoft SQL Server 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

In generated using Flexberry Designer application is required to implement the following business logic. 

1. To implement a business server, which will verify that the dates of the semesters in blocks do not overlap. 
2. To implement a business server that will be used .net-library for verification of the Treaty. 
3. To implement a business server that will check for the absence of one educational program in two or more semesters. 
4. To add a stored field in the student class that will contain the number of selected educational programs for all semesters. Recalculation of this field to implement the business server. 
5. To add a stored field in the class student, which will be a string containing the selected educational program with a priority on semester (sort from high priority to low). Example: Semester number: 1-program 1 2-program 12, etc.
