## Job 

In the framework of the practical part of the course you will have developed end-to-end example: application «project Management - Calendar» (module IC for project management). 

The first part of the practical exercises will be devoted to the development of basic technologies, such as C#, databases, client technology, etc., the second part will include a study of the possibilities of the platform Flexberry to efficiently create applications. 

## General description of the subject area 

You have to develop a module for project management. The project consists of a set of tasks, each of which has a contractor and the period of performance. The task has a certain duration, the start date and end date. The information system should allow accounting tasks with a time control of execution of tasks according to the workload and availability of performers. In other words, when you try to schedule a task so that the time of its execution falls on a weekend or holiday, the user should be issued a warning, blocking the action. Information about which days are holidays and weekends and is the basis for this module. Note that weekends can be national (holidays) and corporate (for one reason or another specified by the user). This module should allow to specify non-working days and they should be taken into account when planning work.

### Job. Part 1. 

You want to implement the algorithms for working with a production calendar. On the basis of information about the standard working week, days, exceptions and gaps of working hours in the week/days (may be more) need to calculate the following information: 

* total duration of working time for a specified date range from ... to ..., including the borders (in hours/minutes); 
* date and end time of time period with specified beginning and a specified duration, given the weekend and after hours (for example, `57` working hours counting from `01.02.2017 `). 

Preferably, first create stubs for classes that implement algorithms and unit tests that checks the operation of the above functions (initially not running); then implement the logic to fix the work unit tests. 

The implementation should be done .net-libraries and to prepare unit tests for it (supplementing written in the beginning, for a more complete code coverage), to show the percentage of code coverage from unit tests (the more the better). The source of data on working days to make a substitute. 

### Job. Part 2. 

Implement a simple ASP.NET WebForms-application (at this stage, no database), which contains the components (. ascx controls), realizowa: 

1. The calculation of the end date of the time interval based on user-entered start date and duration dependence (the component should use the library from the task above). 
2. The display of days of the selected month in a table, where the highlighted weekends. 

### Providing performance verification 

The implemented solution (Visual Studio Solution) to put it all in a repository on GitHub (the solution must compile and run). A link to the repository to provide the teachers of the course.

## Practical exercise No. 3 - the Database 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Microsoft SQL Server 
* Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 
* Git for Windows 

### Job 

For the specified subject area to implement the database, fill the database with scripts (at least 5 records per table). Implement scripts to create constraints, indexes. To attach the scripts to create the database and populate, Bacup database. 

Prepare SQL scripts to obtain the following information: 

1. Print information about the working days exceptions in which the duration of working time less than 4 hours. 
2. To output the total number of working hours for a specified month. 
3. Write a stored function by the passed primary key recurring day exception and the date determines whether this day is the exception passed to the date (including repetition). 
4. Based on the functions from step 3 to write a query that calculates the number of days of exclusions in the specified month. 

### to deliver results 

Implemented scripts commit in the GitHub repository. A link to the repository to provide the teachers of the course. 

## Practical assignment # 4 - Designing the IP 

Will be required for implementation: 

* Flexberry Designer 

### Job 

Draw a UML diagram for the designated subject area. The composition of the diagrams is determined by the trainees, but should provide a full description of the subject area. 

### to deliver results 

The result is uploaded in the format of a CRP stage of Flexberry Designer. Stage (a file with the extension *.CRP) should commit to the repository on GitHub, the link to provide the teachers of the course. 

## the Practical task №5 - Object design and generation applications
