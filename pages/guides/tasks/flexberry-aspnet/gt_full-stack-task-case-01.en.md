Prepare SQL scripts to obtain the following information: 

1. List the teachers that put a maximum on the number of excellent marks. 
2. Output the top N most students are bad students. 
3. Display the subjects for which most of the debtors during the specified period. 
4. Withdraw the rating of faculties according to the average score of the students. 
5. To obtain an average score for each student of the University for years. 

### to deliver results
