These forms have a small amount of data and input lines. You can use different approaches to display and work with them.

## In ordinary forms

### The width of the content

> The recommended width of the field - `450px` - `600px`.

[Entry fields](uiuxg_input_fields.EN.md) on this form must have the same width and arranged in a hierarchical order. It is recommended to group the input fields to function as in the examples below.

Exceptions are only the width of the input field date and time, as their width is fixed.

In this solution, the user no need to switch between the list and the form itself.

Using the slider you can change the width of the list or the edit form.
