## Feedback form

A feedback form is the best way of communication between the webmaster and the user. It significantly saves time. The person who wants to ask a question, no need to waste time in launching the mail client or making a call to customer service to send a letter. All you need to do is go to the feedback form *at the link in the footer of the IP «to Write to tech support»*, enter in the provided fields the user name, email address, comment, attach file and click submit button.

If an error occurs, a feedback form needs to be interactive. It is necessary to clarify the nature of the error and highlight the field in which it occurred:

![Error submitting the form - Write to tech support - Wrong field](/images/pages/guides/ui-ux-guideline/uiuxg_feedback_form/4,5.png)

### Opportunities

* If an error occurs, the IP will automatically appear in the feedback form with the fields filled in **username** and **Information system** in the **Comment** copied all of the error information, which is necessary for the developer and attached a screenshot. The user can fill in field **Email** and add the **Review** for more information.

* The ability to call directly from the form on the support phone number (in the basement) are a good feature for the mobile versions.
