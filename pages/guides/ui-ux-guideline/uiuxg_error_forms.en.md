summary: Basic error pages and the rules for creating such forms.
---

The task of the team is to make the user see an error when working with the System. To do this:

* If you change address in the service set переадресацию;
* Limit the possibility of the user without rights: do not show links to the page or make them неактивными;
* Ensure smooth operation of the service.

The error page for the desktop version as follows:

The very form of the error must be in the lightbox (see item [Lightbox](uiuxg_lightbox.EN.md)) and differ from conventional forms of service, to be brief and informative — so the user will understand what went wrong. It should contain the following elements:

* Заголовок;
* Text of the error. Need to show short cause of the error, and not technical сведения;
* Detailed instructions about what you need to do пользователю;
* Link to the feedback form связи;
* Cross to close окна;
* Button primary actions. For each error has its own: **go to home**, **to write in support of**, **out** and **go** again.
