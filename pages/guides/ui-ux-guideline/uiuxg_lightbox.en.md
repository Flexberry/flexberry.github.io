Form lightbox centered content. The background overlay is clickable, on click the form is closed. A required element of the cross closure (can be disabled if the form cannot be closed).

For light boxes better to use a fixed width for consistency. For example, the shape of the size **S** = `480px`, **M** = `720px`, etc. to Choose the width you need depending on the content of the form. The height depends on content, on your tablet and mobile form adapted to the screen.

>Lightbox **must not have a scrolling**. For long forms you need to use aidpage.
