## Reference

In any Information System there are directories, so the development is necessary to solve the problem of how you store it.

Some Information Systems prefer to keep the background information as a whole in the tree. If this way is taken away a lot of working space on the navigation bar, and is piling up, so it should not be done.

Instead, you need to make a reference similar to other sections in the style envisaged at the moment:

This approach saves space in the navigation pane, and no need to scroll down the page. If the number of directories is too large â€“ enough to competently break them into sections. When you click on one of the guides takes you to a list form:
