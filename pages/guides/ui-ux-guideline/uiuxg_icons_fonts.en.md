The icon should be easy to read» qmo, contain a minimum number of elements. Meaningful must be the whole image on the icon, and not just part of it. It is therefore necessary to pay attention to the context in which are used icons.

The image in the icon should be recognizable and understandable. Before you pick up a metaphor for the icons, you need to see how it is done in other products. The best solution is not to come up with something original, and to make as everywhere. It is very important to choose the image to match the user experience. The icons must be drawn in such a way to directly access the user experience, without symbolism.

## Fonts

![Shafii](/images/pages/guides/ui-ux-guideline/uiuxg_icons_fonts/1.png)

As part of the corporate identity, the font associated with the products of the brand and is one of the most important means of communication with consumers.
The same word, written in different fonts, will be quite differently perceived.

Straight elongated fonts misleading business mood and are almost universal fonts.

## The difference of perception of the serif font and without them

Fonts with serif (serif) are easier to read in printed works. Serifs increase the contrast between the letters and make them distinctive. So our brain is easier to recognize the letter. Reading font without the serif, the brain spends more time trying to identify the letter because its form is not so distinctive.

Fonts without serifs (sans serif) is best used for the Internet. Also, this font looks good in outdoor advertising, as it does not lose its properties when increasing. It is often used in order to attract attention. The sans serif font looks good in small sizes, but for the main text it is better to use a serif – it does not cause rapid fatigue.

## The font size

For the basic version to use the size – 11-12 points. For version for the visually impaired, the font size 18 and more.

## The length of the string

Different length lines may speed up or slow down the reading. It is necessary to pay attention not only on the type of font, but the spacing between letters, lines, etc.

Hyphenation on the web should be avoided. Need to move the word to a new line or slightly change kerning distance. If hyphens too much, change the font size or magnitude of gaps. When you align text to the left shifts do not.

## The combination of fonts

In the process of reading, the eyes get used to the basic font, and they get tired if the headings, table of contents and the secondary text with different font types, not in keeping with the main font. Therefore, when selecting fonts, it is sufficient to refer to one or two fonts, and accents to place due to size, color and shape.

Working with a group of fonts, use them exactly as prescribed, do not confuse the "role"; if the subtitle already you typed in one font, and for the rest of the subheadings use the same typeface. Let it be clear what each of them.

Once the most secure option included system fonts, because they are always in working condition and available on most devices. Today there is no need to compromise and limit yourself «these workhorses». Typically, the web fonts as reliable as system fonts, but offer a greater variety of choice.

*Try these samples:*

[Proxima Nova, Helvetica, Museo, Futura, Brandon Grotesque](https://www.myfonts.com/topwebfonts/) (popular)

[Arial, Times New Roman, Courier New, Helvetica, Times, Courier, Verdana, Georgia](https://www.cssfontstack.com/) (system)

[Gibson](https://typekit.com/search?query=gibson&amp;utf8=✓), [Gotham](https://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview), [Classic Grotesque](www.monotype.com/fonts/classic-grotesque/), [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) (web fonts)

If you want to use for short snippets of sans serif fonts, particularly large, the normal font looks like in this role slightly inappropriate. Instead, use bold and concise style. If you prefer fonts with serifs, serifs are very thin (hairline serifs), usually in short lines work well fonts [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair Display) [Rufina](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rufina) because of their high contrast usually attracts the reader's attention.

Choose fonts that have a classic look and easy to understand. Refrain from fancy fonts in favour of simple and practical. And take into account the purpose of a font: some of them, for example, are more suitable for headlines than for body text.

As for combinations of fonts, don't make them too complicated – stick to three different types, not more. Also, pick a contrasting font. This will help to direct the gaze of the user: first the header, then to the main text. Also create the visual contrast you can use different sizes, colors and font style.

## The length of the header

String length must not exceed **600 px**. Is the optimal size for comfortable eye movement from one line to another. Very wide content part is hard to read — often just lose that line that was going to go long after reading the previous line. If you still need to stretch the text block to 1000 px or more in width, you can try to break the text into two or more columns. Another option is to make the line spacing a little more than usual, to visually harder to separate rows from each other. Don't forget to separate text paragraphs, it will also help make it easily readable.

The distance between the lines almost always must be greater than font size. Except for the headers. To achieve a balance between the text and the» «air, make the line spacing about one and a half times the height of the lowercase letters. Or set the line spacing to 150% of the font size.

For example the text size to 14 px, then the line spacing of 21 px. 14/2 = 7 14 = 21

## The numbers in the font

If you plan to use lots of numbers, keep in mind that there are several different styles for different contexts. Oldstyle figures are preferable to blocks of text such as paragraphs.
