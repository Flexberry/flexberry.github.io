After [prototype](fd_prototype-creation.html) further refinement is carried out by modification of the generated executable code using the APIs provided by technology `Flexberry`. 

In this article you can find a description of the basic principles of revision of applications, as well as the main scenarios of improvement. 

## the Basic principles of re-engineering of applications 

1. Description of the process of obtaining the source code. 
2. [Description of process of generation of code](fd_code-generation.html) 
3. [Development through the modification of the model](fd_code-generation.html) 
4. [Programmer's use of parentheses](fo_programmer-brackets.html). 

## [Main scenario the app.] (fd_development.html) 

1. Managing application forms 
* Adding new forms 
* Customize list forms 
* Customize views 
* Adjust button 
* Customizing edit forms and view 
* Customize views 
2. User interface customization 
* Set form title 
* Alignment of elements on forms 
* Bringing to a common style, color and font of form elements 
* Resizable forms 
* Add localization 
3. Setting up visual logic 
* Connect predictive 
* Implementation of mode “Read-only” 
4. Setting data validation 
* Configure validation on the client side 
* Configure validation on the server side 
5. Implementing business logic 
* Adding checks when updating data via business server 
* Update multiple objects in one transaction 
* Check uniqueness of data entered 
* Check the validity of the data changes object 
* Adding methods decidi\editing data 
6. Setup error handling 
* Enable\disable error logging 
* Customize form error 
* Customize catching exceptions
