**Sequence diagram** - one of the available [kinds of graphs](fd_editing-diagram.html) supported [Flexberry Designer](fd_flexberry-designer.html).

![Example](/images/pages/products/flexberry-designer/diagram/sequence-diagram.png)

**Sequence diagrams are used to clarify the diagram precedents**, a more detailed description of the logic of usage scenarios. This is an excellent tool for documenting project terms of usage scenarios!

Sequence diagrams commonly contain **objects** that **interact within the scenario**, **message** they exchange, and **return results** related messages. However, often the results returned indicate that only if it's not obvious from the context.

**Objects** are denoted by rectangles with underlined names (to distinguish them from classes).

**Messages (method calls)** lines with arrows.

**Return results** - dotted lines with arrows.

The rectangles on the vertical lines under each object show **"lifetime" (focus) objects**. However, quite often they are not portrayed in the diagram, it all depends on the individual style of designing.

## The basic elements of sequence diagrams

On the sequence diagram, you can display the following elements of UML notation that are available in the Toolbox:

Element/Notation | Purpose
:-----------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------
![Example](/images/pages/products/flexberry-designer/diagram/actor.jpg) | Participant (Actor)
![Example](/images/pages/products/flexberry-designer/diagram/objectseq.jpg) | Object (Object)
![Example](/images/pages/products/flexberry-designer/diagram/activeobjectseq.jpg) | the Active object (Active object)
![Example](/images/pages/products/flexberry-designer/diagram/terminator.jpg) | the Terminator (Terminator)
![Example](/images/pages/products/flexberry-designer/diagram/fwdnestedmsg.jpg) | procedure Call (Procedure call)
![Example](/images/pages/products/flexberry-designer/diagram/fwdmessage.jpg) | Message (Flat message)
![Example](/images/pages/products/flexberry-designer/diagram/fwdasyncmsg.jpg) | Asynchronous message (Async message)
![Example](/images/pages/products/flexberry-designer/diagram/dependency.jpg) | message with the result (Return message)
![Example](/images/pages/products/flexberry-designer/diagram/inscope.jpg) | time interval (In scope)
