**Class diagram** - one of the available [kinds of graphs](fd_editing-diagram.html) supported [Flexberry Designer](fd_landing_page.html). 

A class diagram is a key element [editor UML diagrams](fd_editing-diagram.html), because often applications are generated from the class diagram. 
The class diagram is a collection of static declarative model elements. Class diagrams can be used with the direct design, that is in the process of developing new systems and reverse engineering - description of existing and used systems. Information from the class diagram directly displayed in the application's source code. Thus, the class diagram is the final result of the design and the starting point of the development process. 

## Features charting classes 

The main features of the charting classes provided in the following articles: 
* [The key concepts of object-oriented framework for application systems, developed in Flexberry Designer](fd_key-concepts.html). 
* [Features of construction of the class diagram](fd_class-diagram-constraction.html) 

## Capabilities class diagrams 

Main features when working with the charts provided in the article [Editor UML diagrams](fd_editing-diagram.html). 

Specific diagrams features: 
* Change [stereotype class](fd_key-concepts.html) via the context menu. 
* View dependencies through the context menu (functioning similarly to the dependency mapping class [class Manager](fd_class-manager.html)). 

## the Basic elements of class diagrams 
On the class diagram, you can display the following elements of UML notation that are available in the Toolbox:
