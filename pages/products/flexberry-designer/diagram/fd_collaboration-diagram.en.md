**Collaboration diagram** - one of the available [kinds of graphs](fd_editing-diagram.html) supported [Flexberry Designer](fd_flexberry-designer.html).

Cooperation (collaboration) is a static design to simulate a set of entities interacting with each other. Cooperation defines a set of cooperating roles used together to show some functionality.

In the diagram, cooperation, you can display the following elements of UML notation that are available in the Toolbox:
