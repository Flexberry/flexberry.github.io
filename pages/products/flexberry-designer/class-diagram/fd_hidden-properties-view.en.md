The programmer can declare properties that fall into [view](fd_view-definition.html)» «hidden, then they will be in a [view](fd_view-definition.html), but will not be visible in the user interface. 

For declaring the hidden properties you want to initialize the property `Hidden` when specifying an attribute `View`. 

__Example__: 

```csharp
[View("Простое2", new string[]{"Name as Name",  "AnOtherAttrib"}, Hidden=new string[]{"AnOtherAttrib"})]
``` 

## Illustration on the example of comparison of different representations 

There are 3 different ideas: 

* in the first 2 properties and none of them will be hidden 
* in the second the same 2 properties, but hidden 1 
* the third will be only 1 feature (the same that remained "open" in the view number 2). 

Stage | 2 0 the hidden | hidden 2 total 1 | 1 total 0 hidden

For example, it is clearly seen that 1 and 2 are identical in terms of uploaded data (line 5), and 2 and 3 are identical in terms of the user interface (lines 3 and 4)
