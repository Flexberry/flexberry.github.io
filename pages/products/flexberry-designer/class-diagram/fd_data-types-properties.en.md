`Type`, [stereotype](fd_key-concepts.html) introducing the new type. When generating code in the target language you declare the type. Types can't contact any Association, but can be inherited. 

Example: 

![](/images/pages/products/flexberry-designer/class-diagram/type.jpg) 

{% include note.html content="If the classes are in different packages, you will generate 2 separate assemblies to be referenced to each other. Code is successfully generated, but will not compile." %}

## type Description 

Generated | Generate SQL DDL Generation .Net language 
:----------------------------|:--------------------------------|:-------------------------------------- 
| Any part of any UML class (attribute, method parameter, etc.) declared by this class | or As is specified in the transformation map types for the generator As is. Attribute, method parameter, etc. are declared by this type 
UML class | | .Net class 
Attribute UML class | | Public virtual property with the same name and the appropriate modifier (# - `protected`, - `public`, - - `private`), and private member of the class for this property. The type of the property and a private member - type attribute. 
Method UML class | | Public virtual method with the appropriate parameters. The method body empty with a bracket of the programmer to make the code in the method. 

### Additional editable properties and how that is generated 

The properties of the data type as follows: 

1.Tab edit the properties of a UML class:

Property | Description | Generation .Net language 
:------------|:---------------------|:------------------------------------ 
`Stored` | | 
`Name` | the name of the UML class, it is the name of the type | Name .Net-class 
`Description` | Nekotoroe detailed description, if necessary, for explanatory purposes As `DocComment` to the class in code .Net language 
`PrimaryKeyStorage` | | 
`Storage` | | 
`AutoAltered` | | 
`LoadingOrder` | | 
`Trim` | | 
`Packet, NamespacePostfix` | Allow to set the Assembly and namespace in which to generate the type of | see [the Location of assemblies after code generation](fo_location-assembly.html) 
`PBCustomAttributes` | | If the option is given, it is generated [bracket programmer](fo_programmer-brackets.html a) for "manual" introducing attributes to the class. 
`PBMembers` | Allows you to specify whether [brace programmer](fo_programmer-brackets.html) inside a class for the "manual" introduction of the members of the class | If the option is given, it is generated [bracket programmer](fo_programmer-brackets.html a) for "manual" introduction of the members of the class 
`PBClass` | | 
`PublishToEBSD` | | If the option is specified before the class is generated by specifying the attribute `PublishToEBSDAttribute`, which indicates the availability of this class to use the chart editor scripts 

2.Tab edit the properties of the attributes of a UML class:

Property | Description | Generation .Net language 
:----------------|:---------------------|:------------------------------------------ 
`AccessModifier` | access modifier to the appropriate property `.Net` class | Modifiers: - public - private # - protected 
`Stored` | | 
`Name` | the same name of the attribute that the chart | name of the property in `.Net` class, and some derived the name of the private member (depending on format private member that is specified in the settings of the generator). 
`Description`| description for explanatory purposes As `DocComment` to the property 
`Type` | data type properties | type properties and type of the private member 
`DefaultValue` | default | initializer As a private member 
`NotNull` | | 
`DataServiceExpression` | | 
`Storage` | | 
`Hint` | | 
`Order` | | 
`PBCustomAttributes` | | If the option is specified before the definition of properties is generated [bracket programmer](fo_programmer-brackets.html) for manual application .Net attributes. 
`PBGetStart` | | If the option is given, it is generated [bracket programmer](fo_programmer-brackets.html) in the property getter directly after the start code of the accessor. 
`PBGetEnd` | | If the option is given, it is generated [bracket programmer](fo_programmer-brackets.html) in the property getter directly before the end of the code of the accessor. 
`PBSetStart` | | If the option is given, it is generated [bracket programmer](fo_programmer-brackets.html) in the property setter directly after the start code of the accessor. 
`PBSetEnd` | | If the option is given, it is generated [bracket programmer](fo_programmer-brackets.html) in the property setter immediately before the end of the code of the accessor. 
`Autoincrement` | | 

3.Tab of the edit properties methods UML class: 

![](/images/pages/products/flexberry-designer/class-diagram/typepropp3.png) 

In the upper part, the methods in the bottom - options are selected in the upper part of the method.

Methods: 

Property | Description | Generation .Net language 
:--------------|:---------------------|:-------------------------- 
`AccessModifier` | access modifier to a corresponding method .Net class | Modifiers: - public - private # - protected 
`Name` | same method name that the chart | Name of the method in `.Net` class 
`Description` | description for explanatory purposes As `DocComment` to the method. If `IsEvent` specified, the description is generated before the event and before the method wzwodem event. 
`Type` | data type method As the method type. If not filled - `void`. 
`IsEvent`| indicates that this is not a method, and event | IsEvent If specified, the method must have exactly one parameter type that is declared as a [UML class with the stereotype EventArg](fd_eventarg.html). Description EventArg, - is generated by a suitable delegate. Within the class-type - event. Within the class-type - method swadeshi event (like OnXXXXXXX) 
`PBCustomAttributes` | | If the option is given, it is generated [bracket programmer](fo_programmer-brackets.html) immediately before the method to "manual" application .Net attributes.&#93; `IsEvent` If specified, [brace programmer](fo_programmer-brackets.html) is generated before the method of cocking the events OnXXXXXXX 

For parameters of methods: 

Property | Description | Generation .Net language 
:--------------|:----------------------|:--------------------------------------- 
`Name` | the same parameter name that the chart | Name of the method parameter in `.Net` class 
`Description` | description for explanatory purposes As the description of the parameter in `DocComment` to a method whose parameter. 
`Type` | the data type parameter | data Type of the parameter 
`Modifier` | | Modifier transfer of parameters: byref - byval ref; - ничего; out - out; in - in.
