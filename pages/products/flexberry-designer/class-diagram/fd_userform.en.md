The UserForm is designed to determine a blank form, placing controls where you and programming visual logic is executed manually. 

To describe the custom form should be applied to diagram a UML class with the stereotype `userform`, for example:

## generated 

1. The class UI-independent forms. 
2. .Net interface for the dependent form. 
3. UI-related form, just as form (empty). 
4. The shape attributes are generated as follows: 
* Is generated .Net-UI interface-dependent forms with the property definition, but only if this attribute is public. 
* Code UI-specific form is generated which implements the above interface definition of virtual properties, as well as private member and both accessors code for setting/getting the value of a private member, followed by parentheses programmer. 
* Code UI-independent forms generated definition of virtual property with the specified modifier, with the same properties UI-dependent forms through the interface. 
5. Methods of the form are generated in the following way: 
* Is generated .Net-UI interface-dependent form with the method definition, but only if this method is public. 
* Code UI-specific form is generated that implements the above interface definition a virtual method and in this bracket a programmer (like described here). 
* Code UI-independent form is generated by defining a virtual method with the specified modifier. with a call to the same method the UI-dependent forms through the interface.

### form Properties 

![](/images/pages/products/flexberry-designer/class-diagram/userformprops.png) 

Property | Description | Generation .Net language 
:-------------------|:-----------------------------|:--------------------------------------------- 
`Name` | name UML class Name .Net class independent of the form and its derivative for the dependent (e.g., `winformXXXXXX`). 
`Description` | a class description | `DocComment` before the class definition an independent 
`PBCustomAttributes` | allows you to specify whether to brace the programmer immediately before the class definition, for "manual" of any attributes | If the option is specified - generated bracket of the programmer for manual application .Net attributes to class-independent form.
`PBMembers` | | If the option is specified - generated bracket programmer for "manual" introduction of the members of the class of independent form. 
`Packet, NamespacePostfix` | allow to set the Assembly and namespace | see [the Location of assemblies after code generation](fo_location-assembly.html). 
`ScriptName` | the script name to use this form. Matches the name of the EBSD-diagrams used to describe a scenario | Method `GetScript` in the independent class is overloaded so that it returns from the provider scenarios scenario with the specified name. 
`PublishToEBSD` | | If the option is specified before the class-independent form is generated to specify a `PublishToEBSDAttribute` attribute that specifies the availability of this class to use the chart editor scripts. 

### attribute Properties 

The properties of the attributes are the same as specified [in the class Attributes data](fo_attributes-class-data.html), given above (in paragraph 4 "What is generated") comments. 

### Properties methods 

Properties methods similar to those described [in the article class Methods and method parameters](fd_methods-parameters.html), given above (in item 5 "What is generated") comments.
