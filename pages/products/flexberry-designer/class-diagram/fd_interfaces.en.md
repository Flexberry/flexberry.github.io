[Flexberry Designer](fd_flexberry-designer.html) allows the user to describe the interfaces to generate the source code on `CLR`-compatible language, in particular, `C#`.

To describe the interface, you must create the diagram UML class with the stereotype `interface`.

![Example](/images/pages/products/flexberry-designer/class-diagram/interface.png)

```csharp
  public interface Интерфейс
  {
    int Свойство
    {
      get;
      set;
    }
    void Метод();
  }
```

## The properties of the interface

The attributes of a UML class generated definition of the interface public properties.
Methods of a UML class generated definition of the interface public methods.

### Main

![Example](/images/pages/products/flexberry-designer/class-diagram/interfaceprop1.jpg)

Property | Description | Generation .Net language
:-------------------------|:----------------------------------|:---------------------------------------
`Name` | Name UML class | interface Name
`Description` | a class description | `DocComment` before the interface definition
`Packet, NamespacePostfix` | Allow to set the Assembly and namespace | see [the Location of assemblies after code generation](fo_location-assembly.html)
`PBMembers`| Allows you to specify whether [brace programmer](fo_programmer-brackets.html) within the class to `ручного` introduction of class members | Not used
`PublishToEBSD` | | If the option is specified before the class is generated by specifying the attribute `PublishToEBSDAttribute`, which indicates the availability of this interface for use in the chart editor scripts.

### Attribute properties

![Example](/images/pages/products/flexberry-designer/class-diagram/interfaceprop2.jpg)

Property | Description | Generation .Net language
:----------------|:------------------------------|:-----------------------------------
`Name`, `Type`| Virtual property with the same name
The type of the property - type attribute, converted from the original according to [the map display types](fd_types-map.html)
| `Description` | `DocComment` before property definition

### Properties methods event arguments

Properties and generation methods for the interface is performed, as described [in the article class Methods and method parameters](fd_methods-parameters.html), except for the fact that is not generated in the body of the method and [brackets programmer](fo_programmer-brackets.html).

### The rules generate classes that inherit from interfaces

* If the attribute is in the interface, but not explicitly spelled out in the class, it is generated as computable
* If the attribute is in the interface, but also set in a class, it is normal for the stored attribute.

{% include note.html content="the Interface is just a contract and he can not provide the persistence logic of the field. If you need a normal attribute with the storage, you have to inherit from a class, not the interface." %}
