The following stereotypes **not supported** the basic version [Flexberry Designer](fd_flexberry-designer.html) and require additional generators:

* Classes with [stereotypes](fd_key-concepts.html) "*form" (`listform`, `editform`, `userform`) on [class diagram](fd_class-diagram.html) represent the form:

 * `listform` - form with the list of objects of a particular class.
 * `editform` - form creating and editing objects.
 * `userform` - custom form designed to determine a blank form, placing controls where you and programming visual logic is executed manually.
* `Application` - stereotype corresponding to the application.
