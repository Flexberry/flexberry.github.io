## Storage settings path generation 

Setting the path generation is stored in the application configuration file. 

```xml
<add key="GenerationPath" value="C:\Work.NET\CASE\CodeGen"/>
``` 
Thus, if the application will run with a different configuration file, you will need to define this setting again.
