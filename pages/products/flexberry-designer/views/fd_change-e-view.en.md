[Submission form](fd_e-view.html) is responsible for setting elements [edit form](fd_editform.html), as well as for setting up [GroupEdit](fw_group-edit.html)'a for editing objects of the class. When changes in [E-view](fd_e-view.html grade), change the edit form to its objects. 

## changes in performance 

To make changes in the [class view](fd_view-definition.html), you must: 
* Open the class for editing in Flexberry and to make changes in the [E-submission](fd_e-view.html); 
* Re-generate объекты; 
* Re-generate the form.
