Used for [forms editing and GroupEdit](fd_editform.html). GroupEdit is a fast edit object and may have the functionality to open the current object in the edit form. However, other attributes, invisible in GroupEdit'e must also be filled with values. Therefore, to edit form and to GroupEdit'and must be used in one view 

## Setting 

[Visibility](fd_hidden-properties-view.html) is responsible for the list of fields in GroupEdit, as well as for the presence of attributes on the edit form. When generating the edit form it will be located in the attributes, which is a sign `Видимый`. 

Fields [audit](efs_audit.html) not needed, because the functionality to display audit data from the form E itself reads audit data. 
The path describes the location of the fields on the form (`|` tab, `-` group `\` division, for example: `|Description\-Стоимость` specifies that the attribute must be in the group `Стоимость` located on the tab `Описание`). 

Group (groupBox) are used to group logically related objects. Recommended to be grouped in the following categories of attributes: 

* Belong to the same master. 

**Example**: group - `Статья УК`, attributes – `Наименование`, `Номер`, `Часть`, `Пункт`.
