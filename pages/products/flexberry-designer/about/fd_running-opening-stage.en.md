There is an opportunity to make a few shortcuts to [Flexberry Designer](fd_flexberry-designer.html), each of which would open up a different stage.

For this you need to configure the shortcut as follows: the argument to start you need to pass a parameter `path:the Path to стадии`

For example, if the path to the stage "`Репозиторий\Project\Configuration\stage\`", then the string to start would be

```code
Flexberry.exe path:Репозиторий\Проект\Конфигурация\Стадия\
```

![Example](/images/pages/products/flexberry-designer/about/path.JPG)

{% include note.html content="as the path can be specified as repository, project, configuration, stage or system. You can copy the path from the pull-down path string in [Flexberry Designer](fd_flexberry-designer.html)." %}
