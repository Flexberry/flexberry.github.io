There are [several ways to install and configure](fd_install.html) [Flexberry Designer](fd_flexberry-designer.html). One of them is the installation of the application from the archive.

1.To start Flexberry Designer you must have [supported DBMS](fo_data-service.html) (installed on the computer, or somewhere on the network) and [the installed license](fd_install.html).
2.It is necessary to check availability **access** to the server that You will use on Your computer.
3.In the configuration file **Flexberry.exe.config** required to edit settings for data service](fo_ds-provider.html).
For example, [MSSQLDataService](fo_mssql-data-service.html) you can change the connection string, specifying the path to the server :

```xml
<add key="CustomizationStrings" value="SERVER=<server address>;Trusted_connection=yes;DATABASE=CASE;"/>
```

instead of <server address> must specify the path to the server. As the name of the base you can take any, the system will offer to create a database. If you are using MS SQL Server version Express server address will look like **.\SQLEXPRESS**.

4.After starting Flexberry you need to create a Repository for work by choosing the menu item `Репозиторий` – `Создать новый`:

6.Then you must save the changes.
7.After changes in the properties of the repository, you must create the Project and Configuration:

* Enter the project name
Select created project
* Click `Создать Configuration`
