In [advanced settings models](fd_project-customization.html) there is a check mark `Подписывать сборки`. After installation when you generate will be optionally generated files with the file extension .snk (if the project was generated previously, it will also be overwritten file `AssemblyInfo.cs`).

To sign the assemblies from [Flexberry Designer](fd_flexberry-designer.html) necessary utility [sn.exe](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k5b5tt23(v=vs.71).aspx), which you should copy to a folder [Flexberry Designer](fd_flexberry-designer.html) (this utility can be found in subfolders of the folder `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows` (this folder in the system may not be), it is better to be taken from the subfolder with the name "7.0").

About signing assemblies, you can also read the [msdn](http://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/xwb8f617(v=vs.90).aspx).
