## App

![](/images/pages/products/flexberry-winforms/desktop/windesktop.png) 

In the left part is a tree structure of menu items. 

In the right part — the list of so-called `стартеров` (Runner) for the menu item selected in the left part of the menu. 

The programmer can modify the structure, layout and appearance of the menu items, the composition and appearance of the starters. 

Configuration is provided through a special class — Adjuster desktop, a descendant from ICSSoft.STORMNET.UI.DesktopCustomizer. The Adjuster desktop is installed in the property `DesktopCustomizer` form the desktop. 

To indicate the composition of starters and placing the menu items, you should overload the Adjuster desktop method `GetRunners()` that returns a one-dimensional array of starters `ICSSoft.STORMNET.UI.Runner`. 

#### Starters 
Basic starter `ICSSoft.STORMNET.UI.Runner` has: 
* The menu path, the levels are separated with a backslash `\`; 
* Заголовок; 
* A description of the. 

There are a few specialized starters: 
* `ICSSoft.STORMNET.Windows.Forms.FormRunner` — starter form that is different from the standard that a property — the type of form that should open. Accordingly, the starter for opening forms. Method `Run()` overloaded so that designs in the form and calls the method `Show()`; 
* `ICSSoft.STORMNET.UI.ContRunner` — starter independent list container, simultaneously launching in the container the script for execution. Has a property type of the container. Method `Run()` overloaded in such a way that builds a container, takes the script and runs it. 
* `ICSSoft.STORMNET.UI.ScriptRunner` — starter script, located in the specified type implementing the interface `Scriptizer.DataObjects.IScripted`. Method `Run()` overloaded in such a way that launches this script.

Of course, a developer can implement their own starters to implement their functionality or changes to basic in particular, you can overload a number of methods: 
* `GetBigImage(), GetImage()` to change the icons стартера; 
* `Run()` to implement the steps that occur when you select from the desktop. 

#### Form 
In the form of desktop applications (<ApplicationName>Desktop.cs in the initial design) object of type desktopCtrl2 ICSSoft.STORMNET.Windows.Forms.DesktopCtrl has the following properties: 
* __SortRunners__ is responsible for sorting of items in tree and list: 
* _true_ - alphabetical order 
* _false_ - without sorting, the order matches the order of the tasks in Flexberry 
* __ViewMode__ is responsible for the type of display list elements (icons, list, table) 
* __Font__ is responsible for the font of tree items in the list

The menu is configured using the [site Map ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/yy2ykkab(v=vs.100).aspx), the default file `Web.sitemap` from the directory of the application (generated by the system Flexberry). To configure the site map the default `Web.config` in section `SiteMap`. 

The site map is displayed with the help of technological control [IcsTreeView](fa_ics-treeview.html) (this control is [some useful display settings](fa_ics-treeview.html)). 

__Note__: it is worth considering that when regeneration Flexberry ASP.NET through Flexberry made to the file `Web.sitemap` changes may be lost.
