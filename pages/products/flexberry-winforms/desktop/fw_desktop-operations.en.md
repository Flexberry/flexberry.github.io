## Context menu

Consider the context menu invoked by right-clicking the mouse in free space.

![Context menu](/images/pages/products/flexberry-winforms/desktop/context-menu.png)

* `Обновить` – updates all the list items by current position - `listView1.BuildList(true)`.
* `Отображать дерево` – hide/show the treeView (the property `treeView1.Visible`).
* `Показывать папки` – display/displaying a folder in a listView.
* `Группировать элементы` – group/don't group items in a listView (property `ShowGroups`).
* `Столбцы` – choose columns to display in the listView. Column» «Name is always displayed.
* `Всегда group по` – choose the column that will always be group items (property `AlwaysGroupByColumn`).

## Grouping desktop items

Grouping is specified by the property `ShowGroups` (default `true`).
The column to group by default is determined by the column that the ordering of the elements. A group name takes the value of this column from the corresponding element.

For example, if all elements have different names, then sorting by name will display as many groups as all items in `listView`, each group will have one element. The group name will take the name of the contained element.

You can specify the column by which grouping will occur always, even if sorted by another column. For this is the attribute `AlwaysGroupByColumn` (default `null`), it is assigned a corresponding column.

### An example of grouping of items on the desktop

```csharp
listView1.ShowGroups = true;
listView1.AlwaysGroupByColumn = this.ItemType;
```

## Replacement of icons of the list items

If you are not satisfied with the standard icons for folders, custom forms and edit forms, replace them as follows:

* Replacement of the entire group of icons. In the instance of the class `Runner` box for pictures `imagecache` should be `null` (is the default). Then the picture is taken from `imageListRunners` and `imageListRunnersLarge` (to display small (16x16) large (32x32) icons, respectively). As the key uses the following values:

* `IconFolder` – folder
* `IconForm` – custom shape,
* `IconEdit` – editing form
* `IconFolderUp` – to level up.

In a custom application icon changes using the same name field of the component `DesktopCtrl`, except `IconFolderUp` – here it can not be replaced.

* Replacement icons for the specific instance of the class `Runner` (custom form or edit form). The replacement happens in the code of the user application.

### Example (ЛюдиDesktopCustomizer.cs)

```csharp
public override ICSSoft.STORMNET.UI.Runner[] GetRunners()
…
arr.Add(new ICSSoft.STORMNET.UI.ContRunner(typeof(IIS.Люди.Л_ЧеловекL), "People", "Man", "A description of the man"));
arr.Add(new ICSSoft.STORMNET.UI.ContRunner(typeof(IIS.Люди.Л_МашинаL), "People", "The machine", "Machine description"));
arr.Add(new ICSSoft.STORMNET.Windows.Forms.FormRunner(typeof(IIS.Люди.WinformForm), "People", "Form", "Form description"));
…
// *** Start programmer edit section *** (People GetRunners() End) 
((ICSSoft.STORMNET.UI.ContRunner)arr[0]).SetImage("D:\\images\\goldstar3.png"); // "Person" 
((ICSSoft.STORMNET.Windows.Forms.FormRunner)arr[2]).SetImage("D:\\images\\caseberrytmcut.jpg"); //"Form" 
// *** End programmer edit section *** (People GetRunners() End) 
```

## Update ListView

There may be situations where adding, modifying or deleting any objects in `ListView` some elements are not displayed correctly. Then `ListView` need to update force. For this purpose the following methods:

* `BuildList` – rebuild all items in the listView. True as argument means that you need to maintain focus and selection.
* `RefreshOverlay` to update the overlay, in particular the picture (passed argument).
* `RefreshObject` to update the row with the passed in argument object.
* `RebuildColumns` to update existing columns. Is called, for example, after modifying the properties `IsVisible` column.

## Working with Column and Item

The component `ObjectListView` there are some features you configure and add columns and records. First of all you need to say a few words on the support class `ItemInListView`.

Class `ItemInListView` in fact links Items with Columns. `ObjectListView` itself creates a new item and assigns each field to the desired value. To be unambiguous compliance «field in `ItemInListView` – column in `ObjectListView`» field names in `ItemInListView` match the value fields `AspectName` (type `string`) in their respective columns.
The addition of a new item occurs according to the scheme:

* Create an instance of the class `ItemInListView` and filled its fields.
* Add it to `ObjectListView` method `AddObjects` for multiple item or `AddObject` for one item.

With this approach there is no need to work with the subitem's and attached to each item can be referred to as `ItemInListView`:

```csharp
((ItemInListView)listView1.SelectedObjects[0]).Description
```

When creating columns, you need to specify `AspectName` to communicate with and `ImageAspectName` to communicate with the picture. To add columns you need in two arrays.

### An example of setting of columns

```csharp
listView1.AllColumns.Add(Caption);
listView1.AllColumns.Add(Description);
listView1.AllColumns.Add(ItemType);
listView1.AllColumns.Add(ParentFolder);
listView1.Columns.AddRange(new System.Windows.Forms.ColumnHeader[] {
    Caption,
    Description,
    ItemType,
    ParentFolder});
```

## Event TreeViewItemSelected

Event `TreeViewItemSelected` happens with the re-election item in the treeView. Allows, under certain conditions, replace the listView with some of their controls. For example, if selected in the treeView the node is a leaf, i.e. it has no forms and tables, but only the folder (see the property `IsListNodeSelected`) instead of listView show text with background information.

In your application, you need to subscribe to an event `TreeViewItemSelected` instance `DesktopCtrl`. In an inherited class `TreeViewShowControlsEventArgs` need to set this value to true field `Handled` if you want to display your controls and false if you want to display a listView. Further, controls are created and placed in `PanelOnListView`.

### Example of setting selection items

```csharp
private void desktopCtrl2_TreeViewItemSelected(object sender, ICSSoft.STORMNET.Windows.Forms.DesktopCtrl.TreeViewShowControlsEventArgs e)
{
    if (this.desktopCtrl2.IsListNodeSelected)
    {
        e.Handled = true;
        Label label = new Label();
        label.Text = "Some text instead of the ListView";
        label.AutoSize = true;
        label.ForeColor = Color.DarkBlue;
        label.Location = new Point(100, 50);
        e.PanelOnListView.Controls.Add(label);
        e.PanelOnListView.BackColor = Color.LightYellow;
    }
    else
    {
        e.Handled = false;
    }
}
```

## DesktopSettings

Seriousely class `DesktopSettings` is used to store user settings such as window size, column width, columns displayed, etc. in order to setup has been loaded, you need to set the property `UseSettings` class `SettingManager` is true. In this case, settings are saved before closing the user application, and loaded when you start.

Stores the following settings:

* string[] `History` - the story line in `AddressBar`.
* string `curpath` - current path in folders.
* int `Viewmode` mode of presentation. 0 – large icons, 1 – list, 2 – detail, 3 – small icons.
* `FoldersSplitterPos` int - the position of the splitter between the treeView and the listView.
* bool `TreeViewVisible` – display the treeView.
* bool `ListViewShowFolders` – show folders in the listView.
* bool `ListViewShowGroups` – group items in the listView.
* `ListViewAlwaysGroupByColumnname` string – name of column on which you want to always group items (`Caption` - name, `Description`, `ItemType` - type `ParentFolder` - folder).
* `ListViewColumnSort` string – the name of the column that sorts the listView items.
* PstrfListViewSortOrder` SortOrder – the sort order of the listView items order (descending, ascending).
* Display columns: `ColumnDescriptionVisible`, `ColumnItemTypeVisible` – type `ColumnParentFolderVisible` – folder. Column» «Name is always displayed.
The width of the columns: `ColumnCaptionWidth` - name, `ColumnDescriptionWidth`, `ColumnItemTypeWidth` - type `ColumnParentFolderWidth` – folder.

## Desktop shortcuts

The mechanism of labels allows you to work with instances of data objects from the desktop.

Labels should be applied, if in any instance it is necessary to work very often. It will not load the list form and do not look for instance at her.

Labels can be applied to an instance of any class that is the successor ICSSoft.STORMNET.DataObject.

### Folder for shortcuts

The folder in which you can create labels can be specified by overriding a method GetShortCutFolders() class DesktopCustomizer. This method returns an ArrayList whose elements are strings that specify the full path to the folder. By default, this method returns only the folder favorites» qmo.

#### Example folder for shortcuts

```csharp
public class NewDesktopCustomizer : ICSSoft.STORMNET.UI.DesktopCustomizer
{
  …
  public override System.Collections.ArrayList GetShortCutFolders()
  {
      System.Collections.ArrayList arr = base.GetShortCutFolders();
      arr.Add("NewFolder");
      return arr;
  }
  …
}
```

### The name of the shortcut

When you create a shortcut by default takes the name of a list form. To assign a label adequate name, do the following:
The class of the corresponding object, you need to mark an attribute ShortCutCaption. Setting this attribute is the name that will appear with the label. In the name of the shortcut you can specify @name@ where name is the name of a property or field of this class, then the name of the label instead of this design will be substituted the value of the specified property or field of the corresponding data object.

#### Example specify the name of the label

```csharp
[ShortCutCaption("A cat by nickname @Nickname@")]
public class Кошка : ICSSoft.STORMNET.DataObject
{
        …
        public virtual string Кличка
        {
            get
            {
                return this.fКличка;
            }
            set
            {
                this.fКличка = value;
            }
        }
        …
}
```

As a result, the name of the label for the data object «Cat» will, for example, «a Cat named Murka».

### Runners

Runner – a class that implements the methods for running a label. In the designer, a runner takes a shortcut. To add a new runner, you need to create a new class that are inherited from DesktopShortCutRunner. The methods of the runner, marked RunnerMethodAttribute can be started from the context menu of the label, with this type of runner. The attribute parameter is a string that will be displayed in the corresponding item in the context menu of the shortcut.
In the base class DesktopShortCutRunner implemented two standard methods:

* `RunEditForm` – launch the edit form. A parameter is passed the name of the type editing form.
* `RunObjectMethod` – Start method of the object. A parameter is passed the name of the method.

The second parameter of both methods can be passed the name of the view to load the object (this option is not mandatory, but in some cases its absence may lead to errors).
In runner, you can specify default picture labels with the given type.

### How to use runner for labels

Runner, who will run the shortcut that is automatically defined when you create the shortcut.
In order for a runner used to label objects of a particular type, do the following:

1. The runner GetObjectTypes implement a static method that returns an array of types for which you want to apply data runner.
2. Override method GetShortCutRunners() class DesktopCustomizer. This method returns a dictionary whose key is the class name of the runner, and the value is an array of supported types of objects that the method returns GetObjectTypes().

By default, this method returns only runner for the report (ReportRunner).

#### An example of a runner for labels

```csharp
public class NewRunner : DesktopShortCutRunner
{
        …
        public static Type[] GetObjectsTypes()
        {
            return new Type[] { Type.GetType("ICSSoft.STORMNET.MyType, MyTypeAssemblyName") };
        }
        …
}

public class NewDesktopCustomizer : ICSSoft.STORMNET.UI.DesktopCustomizer
{
        …
        public override Dictionary<string, Type[]> GetShortCutRunners()
        {
            Dictionary<string, Type[]> shortCutRunners = base.GetShortCutRunners();
            shortCutRunners.Add("ICSSoft.STORMNET.NewShortCutRunner, NewShortCutRunnerAssemblyName", NewShortCutRunner.GetObjectsTypes());
            return shortCutRunners;
        }
        …
}
```

### Create a label from code

The label is created by calling the static method CreateShortCut. The method takes the name of the shortcut, the path to the folder in which to display the label, the type of runner, a data object corresponding to the label type edit form and picture to display the shortcut. If this parameter is null, the label will be displayed by the default picture. Another optional parameter specifies whether the created shortcut, common or not. If the label is common, it is in a database in the User field will be null in the future it will be seen by all users. If the label is not shared, in the database the label will remain with the current user.

## Status button of the folders on the desktop

In the toolbar of the desktop there is a button `Свернуть/deploy папки`. To display it you need to attach the property `Operations` control desktop value `DesktopOperations.TreeExpandCollapse`. The easiest way to do this in the Main method forms the desktop.

```csharp
static void Main()
{
  try
  {
  ...

      КошкиИЛапыDesktop desktop = new КошкиИЛапыDesktop();
  
  ...  

      desktop.desktopCtrl2.Operations = DesktopOperations.TreeExpandCollapse;
      Application.Run(desktop);
  }
  catch (System.Exception e)
  {
  ...
  }
}
```

## The picture on the desktop

The background picture of the desktop set by the property `listView1.OverlayImage.Image`. You can choose any picture formats `gif, jpg, jpeg, bmp, wmf, png`. You can set an animated image, but to animate it will not. After changing image will need to update the method call `RefreshOverlay`:

```csharp
listView1.RefreshOverlay(listView1.OverlayImage)
```

Alignment of images is performed by setting the required value to a property `OverlayImage.Alignment` (type - `System.Drawing.ContentAlignment`), then it is recommended to update the picture by the above method.

To change the transparency of images, you need to change the field value `OverlayImage.Transparency`. It takes values from 0 (full transparency) to 255 (completely opaque), the default value is 128.

### Example settings of pictures for your desktop

```csharp
listView1.OverlayImage.Image = Image.FromFile("D:\\images\\limeleaf.png");
listView1.OverlayImage.Alignment = ContentAlignment.BottomLeft;
listView1.OverlayImage.Transparency = 50;
```

![Image on your desktop](/images/pages/products/flexberry-winforms/desktop/desktop-picture.png)

Margins horizontally and vertically, respectively, are specified using attributes `OverlayImage.InsetX` and `OverlayImage.InsetY` (type - int)

## Several classes of applications in one stage

If one stage is found in several classes with the stereotype [application](fd_application.html),

![Chart with multiple types of application](/images/pages/products/flexberry-winforms/development/generation/2-app_-u-m-l.jpg)

in the generated Assembly `DesktopCustomizer` will be a few classes to adjust.

__Note:__ DesktopCustomizers a separate Assembly for each application is generated.

## Support Windows XP schemes

Controls `Flexberry Platform` support the scheme of user interfaces `Windows XP`:» «soft buttons, gradients on the tabs, etc., etc., Such support is included explicitly.

To a desktop application supported scheme UI `Windows XP`, you must:

* In the method `Main()` application to invoke a method `ICSSoft.STORMNET.Windows.Forms.WinApplication.EnableVisualStyles()`;
* Create `Manifest` file in the same directory where is. exe file, for example:

Application file — `BugLeR.exe`, the manifest file is `BugLeR.exe.manifest`, content:

```xml
