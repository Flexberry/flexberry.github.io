As [ObjectListView](fw_objectlistview.html) is not used to display data from DB, the standard way to display a list of objects created directly in code, no.

However, there is an algorithm solving this problem.

## The algorithm for adding data

* Create a list of data to display.
* To install `ObjectListView` the type and performance.
* Set `LimitFunction` to base nothing podgruzilo.
* Call method `SetObjects`.

### To create a data list

First, create a proper list of the data that must be downloaded into `ObjectListView`. Not necessarily that the data was in the database.

For example, the variable `myObjects` to which to save the created objects list.

### Setting the type and presentation

For example, to display objects of type `Адрес` representation `АдресL`.

In the code ostanavlivajutsja settings `ObjectListView`:

```csharp
objectListView1.DataObjectTypes = new[] { typeof(Адрес) };
objectListView1.ViewName = "АдресL";
```

{% include important.html content="Despite the fact that the data does not have to be in the database, the representation of the class responsible for this data __should be__." %}

### Lock uploading data from the database

To get data from database is not loaded during the update (pressing the button `Refresh`), you need to install `LimitFunction` have `ObjectListView` so that the condition is never fulfilled. For example, in the following way:

```csharp
objectListView1.LimitFunction = FunctionBuilder.BuildFalse();
```

### Adding objects to the list

To add objects to the list, simply call the method `SetObjects` have `ObjectListView`:

```csharp
objectListView1.SetObjects(myObjects.ToArray());
```

However, if you call this method at the time of creation of the form, the data will be lost when you press the button `Refresh`.

To data is persisted, you must call this method __after loading data from the database__. For this, you need to subscribe to an event `AfterFillData` and add in a handler method call `SetObjects`, for example so:

```csharp
objectListView1.AfterFillData += (o, s) =>
{
	objectListView1.SetObjects(myObjects.ToArray());
};
```
