__To display in the form of a list of objects__ there is a specialized control that `ObjectListView`.

* Set up the debug package (if necessary).
* Choose one or several classes to display. For this you have to initialize `ObjectListView` property `DataObjectTypes`. This can also be done with a special designer, accessible from the edit window properties.
* Choose compatible with all classes of performance. It is necessary to initialize at `ObjectListView` property `ViewName`. This can also be done from the edit window properties. Attention! In the drop-down list are only compatible with all the types listed in `DataObjectTypes`, views.
* Install, if necessary, limitation. For this to initialize a property `LimitFunction`. If you do in the environment VS window edit properties, then a property `Limit`.
