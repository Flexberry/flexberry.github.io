## Enable subsystem settings 
The subsystem is to implement saving the user preferences in the application. 


Access to the system settings provided by the wizard, a set of static class methods `ICSSoft.STORMNET.Settings.SettingManager`. 


In order to enable the subsystem settings, you need to install a static property `ICSSoft.STORMNET.Settings.SettingManager.UseSettings` in `true`. Also, you can do it in `config` file for an application, which requires to add the line: 

```xml
<add key="UseSettings" value="True"/>	
``` 

## Save your own settings 
Saving settings is performed by the function `SetSettings`, read settings function `GetSetting`. 


The settings indicated: 
* The name of the module that saved the settings. It's just a logical name that allows you to set group settings. Hence, when any setting, actually read and cached all the settings for the module. 
* Name settings. 
* The setting value. 
Setting identificireba unique module name, setup name and user name. Username settings Manager recovers automatically. 


Example (saving position and size of the form): 

```csharp
SettingManager.SetSetting("SettingsTest", "Form Position&Size", string.Join(",", new string[]{
					this.Left.ToString(),
					this.Top.ToString(),
					this.Width.ToString(),
					this.Height.ToString()
		}));
``` 

An example of (read the position and size of the form): 

```csharp
	string setting = SettingManager.GetSetting("SettingsTest", "Form Position&Size");
	if (setting!=null)
	{
		string[] splittedsetting = setting.Split(',');
		this.Left=int.Parse(splittedsetting[0]);
		this.Top=int.Parse(splittedsetting[1]);
		this.Width=int.Parse(splittedsetting[2]);
		this.Height=int.Parse(splittedsetting[3]);
	}
```
