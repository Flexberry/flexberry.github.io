A simplified view of the editor allows you to set limits limits of simple functions, combined using "And". You can set the "OR" operation, but only for the same attribute: for this purpose it is necessary to impose some simple constraints on a single attribute - they will be combined via "OR". 

For Boolean attributes available functions "And" and "NO" corresponding to the test of TRUE and FALSE, respectively. 

Example constraints in a simplified form:
