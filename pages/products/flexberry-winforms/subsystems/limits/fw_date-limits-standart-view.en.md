The editor has the ability to apply functions to attributes that are of type "date". 
<br /> 
When you add an attribute of type "date", I see "standard" controls with which you can apply additional functions.

If the function returns a value of another type (e.g. Integer), the type will automatically change. And if there is a value of the same type as the current, it continues, otherwise will be reset.

If you selected [function date](fw_date-time-funtions-in-limits.html) and its argument of type date, it will be applied to the argument.
