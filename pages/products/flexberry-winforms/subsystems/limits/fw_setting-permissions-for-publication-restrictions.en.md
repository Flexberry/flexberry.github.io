## Description 

Configurable __AdvLimitComponent__ as follows: 

* __PublicateOperationId__ transaction id shown (default "-1") 
* __PublicateAccess__ indicates the possibility of access by default (If __PublicateOperationId__ <= 0 or not AzMan can check the access and causing the error) 

## setting in Flexberry Security 

This operation should be registered with a name corresponding to __PublicateOperationId__. This solution is not beautiful, but is used for compatibility with systems running on `AzMan` (for the possibility of a rapid transition to [Flexberry Rights](efs_security-legacy-services.html)).
