One of the basic rules of concurrent programming for Windows forms reads as follows: "«Treatment to the control should be done from the thread that the control was created»". This is normally done by calling methods `Control.Invoke` (simultaneous launch delegate) and `Control.BeginInvoke` (asynchronous start delegate). 
However, it is sometimes necessary to run code in the main thread of the application in the absence of a reference to the control created in this thread. To solve the problem of running code in main thread from another thread in WinForms used class `SynchronizationContext`. In Flexberry Platform to refer to the context synchronization is available by calling `UISynchronization.Context`, `Context` static field is initialized in the form constructor your desktop. 

__Example:__ 

```csharp
if (UISynchronization.Context!=null)
UISynchronization.Context.Send((delegate
       {
       	bugReportProvider.SaveError(_screenShots, sysInfo, exceptions[0] as Exception);
       }), null);
```
