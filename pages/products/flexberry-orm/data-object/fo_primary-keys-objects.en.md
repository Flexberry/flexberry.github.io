In most cases, the developer is not required to use directly primary keys, all keys must be done secretly. However, you can learn (and change) the primary key value of the data object. It is necessary to cause the data object property `__PrimaryKey`. 

## the Generator of primary keys 

The primary keys of the objects generated by the method `ICSSoft.STORMNET.KeyGen.KeyGenerator.Generate`. [Flexberry ORM](fo_flexberry-orm.html) does not know which generator is used and what is the type of the primary key. Specific generator written in the object class data attribute `KeyGeneratorAttribute`. 

The generator can be of two types: 

* Return keys, unique brand. 
* Return keys, unique within the workstation. 

If the generator of the second type, it must implement the method `Unique` return `false`, otherwise `true`. 

The reason for the existence of this method is the following: if the generator of the second type, [service data](fo_data-service.html) to replace the primary key on a completely unique, verify with the General (clientoptions) a key generator implemented in a service. 

This feature is the optimization, because that's absolutely unique keys can be complex to generate, and long, and the constant reconciliation of General generator low. 

Currently implemented generator `ICSSoft.STORMNET.KeyGen.GUIDGenerator` that returns the longest key of the first type. This generator is used by default, the prescribed attribute `KeyGeneratorAttribute` directly to the class `DataObject`. 
The developer can see the type of the key generator for a particular class the data by calling [Information](fo_methods-class-information.html)`.GetKeyGeneratorType`. 

## change the type and rules of the generation of primary key 

If necessary, the developer can change the type of the primary key and the law of its generation, because the primary key in the [Flexberry ORM](fo_flexberry-orm.html) can be of any type.It is important that the primary key type supported the following: 
* Method `ToString()` to convert to a string, and a static method Parse(string) for the reverse receipt from the row key. 
* To implement the interface `System.IСomparable`. 
* Support implicit (imlicit) convert to string and back. 
* Support implicit (imlicit) conversion to the target type store and back. 

All the key generators must inherit from the abstract class `ICSSoft.STORMNET.KeyGen.BaseKeyGenerator` overload all the methods.
