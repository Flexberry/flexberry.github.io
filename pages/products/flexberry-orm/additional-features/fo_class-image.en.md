[Data class](fo_data-object.html) can be associated to the image. 

* `ClassImageFile`. If you always want to use the same image for different instances of the data class, you should put this image into an Assembly as embedded (`embedded`) resource and specify the attribute `ClassImageFile`. 
* `ClassImageProperty`. If the image at different instances of the data class can be used `ClassImageProperty` attribute indicating a property of the data class that returns the image `System.Drawing.Image`. 
* `ExternalImageProvider`. Pictures can be provided by some external provider (attribute `ExternalImageProvider`). 

Except that the picture is displayed in the user interface (e.g., controls to work with a group of objects), the developer can obtain: 

* the picture for a particular data object by the method of [Information](fo_methods-class-information.html)`.GetImageForInstance`, 
* the picture class method `Information.GetClassImage`, 
* the name of the property that provides a picture method `Information.GetClassImageProperty`. 

{% include note.html content="In the build properties with the picture should be correct `Default Namespace` (corresponding to the namespace of the class to which the attached picture)." %}
