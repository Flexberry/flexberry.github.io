## Description

Is convenient to connect to the application to a certain task monitor when you can track tasks (calls some methods), watching the whole process of working anywhere (in a separate window, in the log file). An example is the monitoring of the SQL queries that perform [data services](fo_data-service.html) in the vault.

## The connection monitor task to the application

In order to connect any monitor task, you must do one of the following:

* Code to initialize a static property `ICSSoft.STORMNET.Business.BusinessTaskMonitor.TaskMonitor` an instance of the class monitor tasks.
* Specify in the settings `config` file of the application configuration `BusinessTaskMonitorType` â€” type class, which actually is a monitor task. **This is the main way of connection to monitor**.

### Monitor the status of tasks via config

{% include important.html content="the Assembly with the task monitor must be located in the same directory as the application." %}

For example, the generated Assembly `CustomTaskMon` where the identified monitor tasks `CustomTaskMon.EventTaskMon`, then the connection configuration file the following:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="BusinessTaskMonitorType" value="CustomTaskMon.EventTaskMon, CustomTaskMon, Version=1.0.0.1, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null"/>
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
```

## The entry actions in the task monitor

There is a class `ICSSoft.STORMNET.Business.BusinessTaskMonitor`, with a set of static methods identical to those described in `ICSSoft.STORMNET.Business.IBusinessTaskMonitor`. These methods and should be used if there is a need to write to the monitor task, any of their actions.

For example, to start the action, you must call the `BeginTask`.
