## Console privilege management (Security Console) 

Management console [powers](efs_right-manager-module.html) are given the right to classes and operations. 

The management console powers collected under 3.5 .NET Framework. 

The basic nuances of working with the management console powers: 

* PstrfFull` it represents a permission (Full control) means that for a query on any of the queries on this object (`Update`, `Read`, etc.) will return a positive answer, i.e. the law is. Remember that permissions except `Full` are independent, i.e., the permission update does not automatically give read permissions on the object (such a division actually can be used, for example, the business server when the object is updated, but the user reads). 
* The name may not contain the character _ (underscore) as the character to use as separator in the system and will lead to errors in the future. 
* In the version after 18.07.2014 in win-console added the following logic: if the user selects permission `Full`, check the other permissions (`Update`, `Read`, etc.) are cleaned and locked (they cannot be put until exposed `Full` it represents a permission). The old permissions when you open a new console to change on their own will.
