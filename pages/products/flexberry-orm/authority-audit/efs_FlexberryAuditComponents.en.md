# AuditService 
The application has a class `AuditService`. Through the class `AuditService` implemented API calls: 
* the class that inherits from the interface [IAudit](i-audit.html), if the audit is not in a separate service. 
* audit service `AuditWinService`. 

`AuditService` stores the application configuration audit, where they are loaded in the beginning of the application. 

When performing potentially audited operations [service data](fo_sql-data-service.html) the application informs the class `AuditService` that: 
* scans the existing configuration audit and decides on the need to implement audit records. 
* if auditing is required, then an appropriate message is either `IAudit`, if there is no separate audit service or `AuditWinService` (waiting for a response will depend on the settings of the audit). 

The class implements the interface `AuditService` `IAuditService`, and also has a static field of type `IAuditService` where will be recorded the instance of a class `AuditService` (this will allow to work both with a static class through the reference «AuditService.CurrentAuditService»). All calls are made via an interface (if there is a need, the class `Audit` easy to replace). 

# IAudit 

[IAudit](efs_i-audit.html) is an interface for you to organize the logic of the audit (that is, the class that implements this interface will be responsible for recording audit information and proofreading). 

# AuditWinService 

[AuditWinService](efs_audit-win-service.html) is a service through which it is possible to record audit data. 

# AsyncAuditController 

`AsyncAuditController` class, organizing asynchronous access `IAudit` that allows you to defer for some time the recording of data on audit ("'is not currently in use"'). 

# RemoteAuditController (ServiceAuditController) 

`RemoteAuditController (ServiceAuditController)` class responsible for the interaction through wcf win service audit `AuditWinService` associated with the wcf service, which implements the interface `IAuditWcfServiceLibrary`.
