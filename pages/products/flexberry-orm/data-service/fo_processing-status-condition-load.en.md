When you upgrade in the store data object, any data service account statuses the following way: 

| **ObjectStatus**| **Storage**| **data Object**| 
|:----------------|:----------------|:----------------| 
| UnAltered| Not modify the data| does Not change (remains Loaded/LightLoaded and UnAltered)| 
| Created| Creates data in the store| Change status to Loaded and UnAltered| 
| Altered| Modifies data in the storage| Changing status to Loaded/LightLoaded and UnAltered| 
| Deleted| Removes data from the repository| the Object is deleted from the array of objects to process (null is returned in case of one object)|
