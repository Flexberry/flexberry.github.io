When using the [inheritance](fd_inheritance.html) the problem arises of determining the right type to use for Association. In other words, if [a master](fd_master-association.html) type is the type associated with inheritance, it is unclear what specific type of an inheritance hierarchy is a master. 

For example, there is the following model: 

![](/images/pages/products/flexberry-orm/data-types/primer2.jpg) 

Class `А` has a masters `М`, which has at least two of the heir `M1` and `M2`. 

Accordingly, if a [data object](fo_data-object.html) `a` (an instance of class A) that his master could be an instance of any of classes `M, M1, M2`. 

[Service data](fo_sql-data-service.html) stored object `a` with the master `m1`. 

The problem is: if now, the data service reads an object `а` as he learns» «that the master belongs to the class `M1` and, accordingly, is in the same data structure? After all, he is only known type `M`, but fundamentally impossible to know what types inherited from `M`. 

## the Attributes of a typeusage and PropertyTypeUsage 

To resolve the problem, you can use special metadata that allows you to specify that a property `M` (link to the artisan class) in the class data `A`, in this particular (practical) case, can take only values of type `M`, but also `M1`, and `M2`. In this example, the types `M1` and `M2` are called __types used__. 

Used types are specified: 

1.Attribute [a typeusage](fo_type-usage.html) for [workman](fd_master-association.html)/[metalowego](fo_detail-associations-properties.html) properties of the data class, or for class array metalowych objects (derived from `DetailArray`). 

```csharp
public class A:DataObject
{
	private M fM;
	
	[TypeUsage(new Type[]{typeof(M1), typeof(M2)})]
	public virtual M M {get{return fM;}set{fM=value;}}
}

public class M:DataObject
{
}

public class M1:M
{
}

public class M2:M
{
}
``` 

2.PstrfPropertyTypeUsage` attribute for the data class, whose property should be used to specify types. The attribute is similar, however the class is to write clearer than to a specific property, especially when a lot of them. In addition, this entry is used when you want to change `TypeUsage` in an inherited class, without overloading properties. 

An example entry `PropertyTypeUsage` equivalent `TypeUsage`: 

```csharp
[PropertyTypeUsage("M",new Type[]{typeof(M1), typeof(M2)})]
public class A:DataObject
{
	private M fM;		
	public virtual M M {get{return fM;}set{fM=value;}}
}
``` 

The [Information](fo_methods-class-information.html).CheckUsingType allows you to check inside the property, method, where invoked is compatible with the declared type according to the used types.

## TypeUsageProvider.A typeusage 

Specifying additional attributes cannot completely solve the problem of used types, as the situation may arise: 

![](/images/pages/products/flexberry-orm/data-types/primer-3.jpg) 

Here, the class ancestor is in a separate Assembly, so `TypeUsage` to register will fail, as in the first Assembly it is necessary to know the types `M1` and `M2` (located in the second Assembly, reference the first), and reciprocal link assemblies to each other according to `.Net` impossible. The case could be complicated by the fact that the developer that creates the Assembly 2, in principle, has no access to the source code of the Assembly 1 (and, therefore, it cannot merge assemblies into one). Of course, `TypeUsage` prescribe and in this case, however, you are using a static property of a static class `TypeUsageProvider.TypeUsage`. It contains a variety of functionality for managing used types: you can specify the used types, learn/change their composition, etc. 

At workman communications used types you can specify for the masters of any nesting. It is necessary to specify the names of user controllable properties through the point. Method `TypeUsageProvider.A typeusage.GetCombinedTypeUsage` you can get all types in a single collection.
