## Recommended tools to work with platform products Flexberry

### The tools for Ember applications

__First you need the following:__

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). Allows you to work with tools for front-end outside the browser. Also in the node.js includes npm (node package manager) to work with dependencies in frontend projects, similar to NuGet in Flexberry ASP.NET WebForms.
* [Bower](http://bower.io). Is analogous to npm, but they are often used on the project together.
* [Git](http://git-scm.com). Distributed version control system.
* [Ember-CLI](http://www.ember-cli.com).
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#windows-stable).

__The following will be required:__

* **Browser** and the Ember inspector extension that helps you debug ember-app:

 * [chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ember-inspector/bmdblncegkenkacieihfhpjfppoconhi)
 * [firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ember-inspector)
* **Console** for git, npm, bower, ember-cli, etc.
 * **linux**, might go to any terminal.
 * **windows** standard cmd.exe not the best choice.
 Recommended:

 * PowerShell.
 * ConEmu.
 * Cmder.
* **IDE and text editor**. IDE for js is very resource costly, therefore it is recommended to use text editors such as:
 * Visual Studio Code
 * Atom (it is recommended to install the extensions, tight work)

 * [file-icons](https://atom.io/packages/file-icons)
 * [platformio-ide-terminal](https://atom.io/packages/platformio-ide-terminal)
 * [language-markdown](https://atom.io/packages/language-markdown)
 * [markdown-preview-plus](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-plus)
 * and other.

It is necessary to send commits to the remote repository on GitHub.

{% include note.html content="a problem May arise that when checking through the console (git in Powershel, for example) an error will be returned. Then you need to restart the computer. If this does not help - to reinstall git (remove and reinstall). "%}

#### Algorithm install Ember CLI

{% include important.html content="Before you install Ember CLI, you must first install Node.js and Bower" %}

1. When npm and bower installed, you need to install [Ember CLI](https://ember-cli.com/), the command will be `npm install-g ember-cli@2.4.3`.
2. After installing Ember CLI, enter the command `ember -v`, if issued, the version number is the installation was successful.
