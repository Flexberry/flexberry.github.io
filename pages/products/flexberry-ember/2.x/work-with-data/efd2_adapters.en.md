## Description

A great description is in the [documentation on the official website](https://guides.emberjs.com/v2.4.0/models/customizing-adapters/).

## Configuring the adapters in the app

When generating the application `ember-flexberry` file is created `app/adapters/application.js` with the following contents:
```javascript
import { Projection, Adapter } from 'ember-flexberry-data';
import config from '../config/environment';

export default Adapter.Odata.extend(Projection.AdapterMixin, {
  host: config.APP.backendUrls.api,
});
```

This is the adapter for the application, which specifies the address `OData` service.

If the model has not defined your own adapter, use the adapter application.
To determine the adapter for a specific model, you must create an adapter with the same name as the model, it can be done with the command:

```cmd
ember g adapter my-model
```

The result of this command will create a file `app/adapters/my-model.js` with the following contents:

```javascript
import ApplicationAdapter from './application';

export default ApplicationAdapter.extend({
});
```

In order to change the address `OData` service for this model, it is necessary to override the property `host`, specifying the new address `OData` service. For example, if the configuration of the second address `OData` service specified in the property `api2`, you get this:

```javascript
import ApplicationAdapter from './application';
import config from '../config/environment';

export default ApplicationAdapter.extend({
  host: config.APP.backendUrls.api2,
});
```
