The update is recommended to perform consistently switching versions `ember-cli` to run on each new version of the initialization of the project and controlling the collection of project and testing. You should also closely monitor `DEPRECATIONS`, because from version to version, they turn into errors.
The most convenient way to use `ember-cli` with multiple versions is to use [Docker-container ember-cli](ef2_docker-for-ember-cli.html).
