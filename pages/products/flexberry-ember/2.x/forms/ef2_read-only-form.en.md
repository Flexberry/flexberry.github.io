summary: This feature allows you to access ember-form read-only
---

## Description
For operation in mode *read-only* in the base controller and edit form property is added `readonly`.

Thus, to open the [edit form](ef2_edit-form.html) read-only, you can:

* To pass a GET parameter in the query string, like so: `http://localhost:4200/orders/10251?readonly=true`.
* To override the definition of the value of the property `readonly` in the controller.

Processing of this parameter is used in the following versions:

* This property may be transferred into the [controls inherited from the base control ember-flexberry](ef2_controls.html).
* This property can be used to determine which buttons can be accessed by the user.

A variant design of the form template edit to account for the possibility of working in read-only mode are presented [in the article](ef2_edit-form.html).
