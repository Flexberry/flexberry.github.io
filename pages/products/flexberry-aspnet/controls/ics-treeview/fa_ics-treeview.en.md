## Desk

In a Web application desktop will be transformed into a set of links in the menu SiteMaster'a.

![Desk web application](/images/pages/products/flexberry-winforms/desktop/webdesktop.png)

The menu is configured using the [site Map ASP.NET](http://msdn.microsoft.com/ru-ru/library/yy2ykkab(v=vs.100).aspx), the default file `Web.sitemap` from the directory of the application (generated by the system Flexberry). To configure the site map the default `Web.config` in section `SiteMap`.

The site map is displayed by means of process control `IcsTreeView` (this control has a number of useful display settings).

__Note__: it is worth considering that when regeneration Flexberry ASP.NET through Flexberry made to the file `Web.sitemap` changes may be lost.


Web control `ICSSoft.STORMNET.Web.AjaxControls.IcsTreeView` - heir `System.Web.UI.WebControls.TreeView`, differs in that it is able to remember the state in cookies and to expand/hide the branch by clicking on the inscription of the site instead of the arrow to the left.

## Properties

In addition to the properties inherited from `System.Web.UI.WebControls.TreeView`, present:

|Signature | Description|
|:-----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------|
| `public int? CookieExpiration` | life Time state of control in these days. Example: `ctrlCtrl.CookieExpiration = 10;`|
| `public bool RememberState` | does the control remember condition. Default `true`|
| `public ToggleOnNodeClick` bool | whether to hide or reveal child nodes by clicking on the inscription. This action is performed if the node is not assigned to another link, otherwise, click on it. When `ToggleOnNodeClick == false` and the absence of a reference node is negligably inscription. Default `true`|
| `public static InitControlSettingsDelegate<IcsTreeView> InitSettings` | a Static delegate to customize the control. More info below|
| `public bool CollapsedState` | the Parameter that determines whether the first display to display a tree in a collapsed state (if tree stored cookies, then the corresponding vertex will still be displayed in the specified in the cookie)|

## Setting
