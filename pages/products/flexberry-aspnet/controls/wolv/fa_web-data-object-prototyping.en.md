## How prototypical in Flexberry ASP.NET 

If the GET-request for the form transmitted, in addition to the primary key of editable object that `Prototyping=true`, the system understands that you will need to create a new object based on the object with the specified primary key. 

## features of the implementation 

* The very prototypical is executed when the object is saved using the method of [Prototyping](fo_data-object-prototype.html). 
* In the original, there is a lock that is removed when you first save the object's prototype. 

## WOLV and "basing" 

[WOLV](fa_web-object-list-view.html) provides the ability to perform prototypical object. To do this, the appropriate [WOLV](fa_web-object-list-view.html) must include [NewByExampleInRow](fa_wolv-operations.html): 

```csharp
public partial class КредитL : BaseListForm<Кредит>
{
	//... 
	protected override void Preload()
	{
		WebObjectListView1.Operations.NewByExampleInRow = true;
	}
}
``` 

Each line of the web control will have an additional icon, clicking on which will be done no editing of the selected object, and its prototypical.
