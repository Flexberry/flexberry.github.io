By using Operations, you can configure the behavior WebObjectListView.

To access the Transactions through the property `Operations` control.

To enable print button, list, execute the following code when the page loads:

```csharp
webObjectListView1.Operations.Print = true;
```

## The default operation

To set the default operation for all applications through the configuration file `web.config`

For this you need to add the key `WOLVDefaultOperations`, as the value to specify the list of operations separated by commas.
The key is added to the section `configuration` - `appSettings`:

```xml
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <!--Other keys-->
    <add key="WOLVDefaultOperations" value="Refresh,Filter,Search,New,Delete,ShowMarks,EditInRow,ConfigureColumns,NewByExampleInRow,ExportToExcel,AllowColumnResizing,LimitEdit,EditOnClickInRow,FixTableHeader,HighlightObject" />
    <!--Other keys-->
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
```

## CheckChanges

This property works only in cases where the WOLV is on the edit form.

When you try to leave the page (for example, clicking on the "Close" button) is enabled verification of changes made to the object. If the object has been modified, the user will wonder whether he wants to keep it.

Similar functionality was added to the list located on the edit form: for example, if the user tries to add a new item (and thus to make the transition form one object to the edit form of another), then the system will ask him if he wants to save the changes.

Operation `CheckChanges` enables or disables this check.

{% include note.html content="If this setting is disabled, the processing of saving the changes imposed on the application programmer.
You can use the [events](fa_wolv-events.html list), or [JS API](fa_js-api-wolv.html)." %}

By default this option is enabled.

For example, in order to lucapa the filter operated without the use * need:

```csharp
public override void ApplyLookUpSettings(WebObjectListView wolv)
        {
            base.ApplyLookUpSettings(wolv);
