## download to Excel (instructions to the programmer) 

[WebObjectListView](fa_web-object-list-view.html) allows to download data in Excel format. 

This feature is included with the operation: 

```csharp
/// <summary> 
/// Called the first in the Page_Load. 
/// </summary> 
protected override void Preload()
{
    WebObjectListView1.Operations.ExportToExcel = true;
}
``` 

### the View to export 

Ask a [view](fd_view-definition.html), the default for export is possible from code by setting the `ExportView` [WOLV](fa_web-object-list-view.html): 

```csharp
WebObjectListView1.ExportView = Клиент.View.КлиентExport;
``` 

### Unloading of datalow 

Unloading of datalow occurs if they are present in a [view](fd_view-definition.html). The user can configure the settings metalowego column as well as other properties of the object. 

There are 2 settings on the [web edit](fa_editform.html) to control the unloading of detailov. 

1. Detailov fields in separate columns. 
2. Detaily in a single row. 

* If 1 of the settings is not set, then detaily unloaded in 1 cell in the line: 

| Aggregator | Detail| 
|------------|--------| 
| Field of the aggregator | Detail: 1st Field детейла; Detail: Field детейла; Detail 2nd: Field 3rd детейла;| 

* If there is a setting `Поля of datalow in a separate столбцы`, detaily unloaded in 1 cell in a column: 

| Aggregator | Detail| 
|------------|---------| 
| Aggregator field | Field 1st of detail| 
||2nd field of detail| 
||3rd field of detail| 

* If you set both settings at once, each detail will be displayed in a new line, and a field aggregator with different strings will be merged into 1 cell.

* To set only the setting `Детейлы in a separate строки` until bessmyslenno, conducted a revision this setting. 

__Note__: if you have an idea of the field of detail not specified title as the title field when uploading, you will use the field name. 

### data Service 

The default for the Excel spreadsheets used the data service `DataServiceProvider.DataService`. If you want to ask another, separate service data to unload in Excel, this can be done in `Web.config` by registering a service under the name `ExcelExportDataService` in `Unity`. The example configuration below for the Excel spreadsheets used the data service `IcsharpSoft.STORMNET.Business.DRDataService`: 

```xml
<unity xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/practices/2010/unity">
  <container>
    <register name="ExcelExportDataService" type="IcsharpSoft.STORMNET.Business.IDataService, IcsharpSoft.STORMNET.Business" mapTo="IcsharpSoft.STORMNET.Business.DRDataService, IcsharpSoft.STORMNET.Business.DRDataService">
      <constructor />
    </register>
  </container>
</unity>
``` 

#### Ogranichenie on the maximum number of objects 

To configure the maximum number of exported objects should be vopspolzovatsya configuration parameter `WOLVExportLimit`: 

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <appSettings>
    <add key="WOLVExportLimit" value="10000" />
  </appSettings>
</configuration>
``` 

Negative values of the parameter, and 0 disables the limit on the maximum number of exported objects. 

### adding a table for storing settings 

To add a database table to store user settings, you must have a data structure that is used [UserSettingsService](fa_user-settings-service.html). The table is generated automatically.
