* Create a constraint based on the current 
* Be the restriction 
* Add condition 
* Union (OR) 
* the intersection (And) 
* negation (NOT) 
* To change the operation in the condition 
* logical operations: 
* Union (OR)

## soft reset restrictions 

For software reset superimposed on the restrictions list on the server side it is sufficient to call the method 

```csharp
WebObjectListView1.DropLimitFromLimitEditor();
``` 

## select a value from the database 

*When choosing values from the database to optimize displays only the first 100 values that meet the condition.* 
There is the possibility to filter the values from the database. For this special field to enter a value, which must be a substring in the resulting found elements. 

## wildcard Search 

You can set a limit on the mask. The corresponding element is added to the ribbon editor.

At the moment, imposed some limitations on the pattern: 
* "*" - 0 or more any characters. 
* the " _ " is exactly 1 character. 
* To search for a substring, you must at the beginning and end of a string to specify the character "*". For example, to search for substrings that contain the sequence 123, you need to set a wildcard "*123*". 
* Escaping characters and some special characters are currently not supported (this is including [the limitations of using Regex in queries to LinqProvider](fo_linq-provider.html)).

## to Count the number of rows 

On the tab there is a button `Главная` `Подсчитать number строк`, by pressing on which is issued the number of objects satisfying the current constraint.

### Limitation parameters to the user
