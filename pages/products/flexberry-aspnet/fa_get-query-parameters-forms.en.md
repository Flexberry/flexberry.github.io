The GET-request for a LookUp form and the edit form in a modal window. 

Before in that and in other case we used a parameter called "LookUp": 

1. The basic editing form to determine which form opened in a separate window. 
2. In the script MasterEditorAjaxLookup for those occasions when, instead of technological LookUp form uses arbitrary list form: 
* based on this flag is set WOLV.LookUp (in technological form, the flag is not processed, it is considered that WOLV have a LookUp editor); 
* based on this flag is configured (for example ReadOnly) if the preview object. 

It is recommended to use a **different flags** for these purposes. 

{% include note.html content="In the code of applications is not necessary to explicitly use constants `LookUp` etc., as their value may change in the future. For special technological parameters from the request, use class WebParamController." %}
